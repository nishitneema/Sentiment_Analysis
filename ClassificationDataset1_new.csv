review,sentiment
 the flatiron in the room turned out to be broken very few receptacles,0
 Excellent breakfast and good service Very comfortable room and bed Personal touch of card and cake for anniversary Proximity to St James Park and Buckingham Palace for a walk the morning after our celebration dinner ,1
 Loads of roadworks around entrance made access on foot tricky Couple of sidelights in room did not work Shower controls a bit of a mystery ,0
 A little far from the centre but trams frequent,0
No Negative,0
 Rooms on top floor very warm,0
 They had our rooms mixed up and gave our key to someone else after we d checked in Another couple walked in when we were having a nap Not great Room are tiny however I appreciate that goes with the territory in London ,0
 It might have been useful to know there are roadworks ongoing outside the front entrance This didn t affect me as I was at the back but some customers might have been bothered by the noise ,0
 Great location equidistant from the various must see sights in London ,1
 The bed was not too comfortable,0
 Breakfast and bathroom facilities,0
 Location and court yard how quiet it was ,1

 The elevator and at night the room was so cold,0
No Positive,1
No hot water in the morning as the boilers broke which meant we couldn t get a shower bath before leaving The kettle leaked from the glass indicator so we was unable to use that too For 200 I expected a lot more,0
The hotel is clean The staff is very friendly The room was relatively big so I had space to move around The staff is super friendly and the Location is perfect The tube is extremely close and while you usually have to switch trains the fact that the station is small and easy to get around is a big bonus For example you might think that being close to Kings Cross is a better location but that station is huge and just to get in and out of it is at least 10 minutes and that s if you get the exit right Switching trains is very easy and convenient and in my opinion should not be taking into consideration when choosing a location It s also located in front of Russel Square Park which is very nice,1
 Loo flush wasn t very effective bit of an acquired skill Not enough plug sockets in room coffee terrible,0
 Location very good Staff very friendly Enjoyed reading about history of building,1

 Breakfast wasn t included in the price,0
 Everyone was very polite and the food was excellent I will definitely stay there again,1
 The location was great felt secure and safe Lovely surroundings and interior The restaurant was splendid The staff were very friendly ,1
 Very good location safe and quiet in Latin Quarter can walk or take metro easily to most attractions and RER directly to the airport And late afternoon I can always have a recess at the bueatiful Luxembourg park around the corner Plenty of nice and affordable local and Asian restaurants I like especially Au P re Louis and Sushiyaki I stayed for six nights and came back for dinner every day This area is only a couple of minutes walk off the major tourist zone but already much less noisy and you got better food and service My room is on top floor and the view is awesome one day I saw sunset on Effel tower and it was amazing ,1
 Facilities were great my room was great value for money and the restaurant was great ,1

 The room was amazing value for money Plenty of room to spread out for a young family Self contained kitchenette was handy for a long stay ,1
I do really love the balcony we spent many days here and every morning when I wake up the balcony made me a very happy morning The location is also great for women there are many nice food restaurants and nice shops you do not need to worry that nothing to do in the evening because near the hotel there are also many nice bar with good view Just 5 minutes walk to Luxembourg park is also great,1
 Absolutely great hotel Comfy rooms clean great staff great location ,1

 small room,0
No Positive,1
We usually book a Delux or Club room at this hotel but our funds were a bit tighter for this visit so we booked a Superior Standard Room It was adequate for just going to bed in however the bathroom which only had a shower cubicle some have baths with built in baths our bathroom was ridiculously small no elbow room at all There was significant corrosion under the sink on the fittings and the wall was pitted beneath one of the switches in the bedroom area The heater was effective but very noisy and our window was rather drafty Our room was to the rear of the hotel and by 6am we could hear the faint sound of the tube station below the hotel even on the 3rd floor,0
No Negative,0
 Bed too soft and air conditioning was poor The room was really hot ,0

 Room was neat and clean Beds were comfortable TV with lots of channels Tea with percolator provided and some snacks BEST is the location Lots of different type of restaurants close by Favorite for Breakfast was La Roma a small boutique Restaurant located just around the corner GREAT Breakfast and Lunch VERY easy access to UnderGround ,1
The standard room was really too small so they offered to upgrade us to a bigger room We really appreciated that because we were going to spend 6 days in that hotel But even the bigger room is not that big however we realized that this is the case in nearly all London hotels The room did not have central heating It was December and for people like us who are accustomed to warmer climate the room was really cold When we told about it they supplied an electric radiator for us which heated the room but the bathroom was still very cold As in all London central hotels this hotel is also not value for money If it were say in Munich or Milan it definitely would be half this price,0

 Location,1
Room was extremely small with very strange walk in wardrobe space I feel the layout of the room and the dark wood did not help Not good if you are claustrophobic Also as we were in an internal room we were unable to open the windows Bathroom tiny but adequate with a fantastic shower Anyone of a larger build would struggle to move around in there I would suggest a taxi from the station or underground if you have any luggage as its approx a 7 10 minute walk and there are a few junctions to negotiate,0
 Extremely comfortable clean and well appointed rooms Staff were all very helpful and friendly A good nights sleep too ,1
 The sofa bed is pretty terrible and I absolutely hate the door to the bathroom It s a sliding glass door which provides very little privacy ,0
 For the price of a superior double room I was expecting more and bigger ,0
 Great Room nice and compact but tidy and comfortable,1
 Probably one of the best hotels we have stayed in Staff were excellent and very helpful from the doormen to the front of house staff The champagne and cake for a birthday treat was a very pleasant surprise ,1
No Negative,0
 Nice room and decent evening dinner ,1
Room was a bit small for 2 adults and 2 children not much room to move around in My husband requested a special children s pack for my daughters birthday which included ice cream and it arrived much later and all melted left in our room Also when they removed it and we requested another one it took almost an hour I had also informed the hotel it was my daughters birthday but nothing special was done about this If it wasn t for my husband paying extra for the kids package we could have been at any hotel,0
 Couldn t work out how to turn on the heating plus bathroom was cold ,0
 Bed was too small ,0
 Located opposit Hyde Park Beautiful property great facilities lovely room Staff were amazing suoer helpful Queens Park underground only a minutes walk away Enjoyed our stay very much ,1
 Free use of mobile phone in the room is a excellent bonus Club sandwich on the brunch menu was superb ,1
 Room was quiet and comfortable nice to have iPod speakers ,1
 Location,1
 Excellent location for theatre trip and the hotel rooms are superb,1
We only stayed 2 nights,0
 The bathroom was badly designed You couldn t go in after someone had taken a shower as there was no shower basin just a trendy drain away style hole in the middle The tap didn t work properly either,0
The wines provided are terrible and expensive 17 for half bottle We were very disappointed specially because France is famous for good wine We opened 2 bottles rose and red and only had a sip as it was horrible We were also charged for a bottle of white wine which we didn t have Although we do think they charged us by mistake and we didn t realised while checking out to ask them to remove it,0

Room wasn t ready on arrival after travelling from Leeds to London and phoning 2hours away to reserve parking Rude receptionist to girlfriend about parking as it wasn t our fault someone had taken our space We arrived at 16 00 and our room wasn t ready so was given a complimentary drink each and half an hour later still wasn t ready and being told it would be a further 40minutes Just wasn t good enough as we were only staying for 1 night and had a concert to go to,0

we had no cold running water with 2 days to go we were offered another room which was a bit of an inconvenience to move our things and room was much smaller we were offered breakfast on next 2 mornings as compensation as it wasn t included in our price so that did make things a lot more acceptable,0

The room for the price When I went through booking com I looked at the pictures under the room I was booking The room I got and the pics of the room was completely different ends of quality I m lucky I complained and they gave me an upgrade 150 pounds for this I wouldn t have paid 75 for it,0
No Positive,1
 The hotel is in a very central location but tucked away quite discreetly so it feels private The room was very comfortable no sound carried over from the rooms or hallways allowing us a decent night of sleep The bathroom was beautifully luxurious and clean We also had a drink in the hotel bar which was very good ,1
 Too many issues to get sorted with the room Bath plug not working no remote for the T V piece of skirting board kept falling off which had a nail sticking out had to keep asking to get tea and coffee renewed and for the sheets to be changed Staff were very helpful and kept sending people up to sort problems but for what we were paying we expected more There were also a lot of roadworks outside the hotel which meant we didn t use the hotel cafe and it took longer to walk some places ,0
We stayed here 3 times during our holiday and a couple of the rooms on the lower floors were a bit tired soap holders falling out of the wall fridges that didn t work etc,0
Reception and concierge staff very efficient and friendly Got a free room upgrade much appreciated Studio room 1108 was superb what a view Fantastic in room facilities and very comfortable,1
Booked a room with a view as read some poor reviews stating facing into a wall First room had a view but mould all round windows vile smell of damp Only available other room faced into a court yard of airconditioning units the air con did not work properly in room and couldnt open windows because of all the noise from units outside Was given a small electric fan and complementary bkfast as compensation but did not sleep due to heat lack of aircon and inability to open windows Only one hour free Wifi Would not stay in this hotel again Paid 70 for twin room,0

 In the area around the hotel there was nowhere open for breakfast at all When we asked why its because it is mainly a commuter working area so we ended up not being able to get any breakfast not the Apex hotels fault may I add Advice would be if you have plans near the hotel definitely book breakfast at the Apex The concierge was also a little rude and unhelpful Not a big issue nor is that the hotels fault ,0

 Did not like the same breakfast menu every day People with long stay gets bored with eating same thing again n again You need to change the menu on alternate days ,0
I stayed for 5 days in the hotel First of all the room was very small and not like in the picture very small Then the A C controller was not working in the room so each time I had to call the reception to change the temperature of the room And the door of my room was in the front of the lift and because it is very old lift there was noise from the lift They told me they will change the room but they didn t,0
 There s a lot more that could be done Unemptied bins ashtrays Basic amenities Single bedrooms are very small I was expecting small but still surprised ,0
 Not alot,1
 the bar,0
 The staff were friendly and polite The location was ideal for commuting in and out of the centre of London easily There were ample places to go for a meal within walking distance ,1
 For the first timers the location would be confusing as there were many hotels in the same name of Park Grand in around the same location Its hard to find your way back by walking if you forget the landmarks The Bathroom is very small congested ,0
There was no chain on room 515 The deadlock was broken just spun around There is no shower door or curtain in the bathroom The front desk staff seemed a little inexperienced,0
 The room was quite small,0
 I,0
 A bit noisy You can hear a lot through the walls It s a shame the construction is still going on however there is minimal disruption from this and it sounds like it will be great when done ,0
 The rooms are small ,0
 I hated that the bathroom didn t have a real door It was only separated by a sliding partition that didn t offer much privacy The checking in and out process was not smooth Room was not ready when I was told and had to come back a couple of times before it was ready When I checked out I was given somebody else s bill I did not feel that the accommodations equaled the price I was charged ,0
 It was my son s birthday and staff left a card complimentary snacks and drinks etc Kids pack was also great with euros for them to spend in treats ,1

 The location of the hotel is perfect It s within walking distance of the major attractions of the city or close to Temple or Blackfriars tube stations should you want to go further afield The superior rooms have very modern decor and the large bath is a real pleasure after a long day walking There are safes in the rooms and tea and coffee making facilities for that first morning cuppa The room was very quiet at night the bed is very large and comfortable the curtains keep the light out overall giving a good nights sleep The staff are very attentive polite and helpful ,1

 The location ,1
 Location,1
 The building is old and the decor shabby What you see on the booking site isn t the room you get Our room was small carpet worn Windows filthy and a tiny bath with a tiny TV ,0
Not only was the hotel of a luxurious standard what else would you expect of a five star on Park Lane but it was the attitude of the staff who really made our trip extra special Upon arrival I mentioned that it was our 10th wedding anniversary and asked if there was a chance of a complimentary upgrade Luckily they weren t full so we got a lovely upgrade to an exec room which was super spacious and a free late check out Not only that when we returned from our meal out the reception manager had organised for a beautiful chocolate gateaux and bottle of red wine to be in our room on the house Such a classy move considering we were already more than happy with the upgrade and really made our trip even more special Considering we re not your average five star hotel clientele I was so impressed by the intercontinental s approach to treating us like VIP S you made our anniversary so memorable and we ll definitely return again,1
 Excellent location and Excellent property Clean spacious rooms ,1

 The staff were fantastic Excellent service,1
 We had just one night in London and the hotel s location let us make the most of it Took the tube directly from Heathrow no transfers and found the hotel right around the corner from the Russell Square tube station The next day it was an easy walk to St Pancras Station to catch the train to Gatwick We spent our day in London eating shopping and visiting the British Museum everything within extremely easy walking distance Grand old hotel with updated comfortable rooms and magnificent public spaces It occupies nearly a block and the hallways are quite long and could probably be updated but the rooms are very pleasant indeed Stayed on a Sunday night when the room rates were exceptionally low they re much higher the rest of the week Charming doorman too ,1
Breakfast service and food quality not the best for this kind of hotel Personal note poor phone reception 5 for small bottle of evian,0

 The room was very much smaller than I anticipated It must have been smaller than it should have been because the receptionist informed me that it was very small as I checked in I had expected to have a small living area and that was why I booked this particular hotel as I did not want a traditional hotel room I did not get that ,0

 Not really a restaurant or bar but opposite the hotel there is a fantastic wine bar and there are plenty of restaurants in the area to explore ,0
 Reception was a not efficient I tried to pay for the length of my stay upon checking in but the reception was adamant that I pay the first night I told her that it was better if I do only one transaction on my card but she won t have any of it but after we have done the transaction on the card she asked me if I want to pay the rest of my stay So I thought that was really bizarre She wasn t friendly at all and just get on with what she was doing Came down the following day to pay for the rest of my stay and no greetings only after the transaction she remembered that she ought to ask if my stay was so far any good ,0

 Amazing breakfast options and the staff were very friendly and helpful,1
 Food was excellent I ordered room service on both nights and it was exceptional,1
 Upon check in I was asked to move to a sister property Apparently my room was under rennivation the sister property room was a shoebox size They miraculously found a room for me at the first hotel and the room was extremely small Incredibly dirty I will not be back I checked out after one night and paid a penalty fee I will not be back ,0

My sister and I bought our parents a trip to London for Christmas and we all went in the end of March We stayed at Grand Royal Hyde Park for 4 nights and enjoyed every minute of it The staff was lovely and always very helpful the breakfast buffet was amazing with heaps of different things to chose from and the dining area had such nice old London interior which is what we wanted for our stay the rooms had a more modern feel interior and the rooms were a bit small but since you re always out and about while being in London anyways it didn t bother us at all as long as you have a roof over your head and a bed to sleep in we re a ok The hotel is basically across the street from Hyde park and only 2 min walk to Queens Way underground which easy takes you where ever you want around London Very centred perfect spot if you want to live close to basically everything So yeah definitely a place we would all return to A really nice hotel for such a decent price which is hard to find so centred in London in general Awesome staff and service Great breakfast and a really nice bar downstairs by the lobby for afternoon drinks before heading out for the evening Will definitely return,1
 I would say that our bathroom could do with being updated as it was noticeably rusty Otherwise it was a great stay ,0

 Bed was comfy Staff gave excellent service ,1
I have stayed here occasionally over 5 years The breakfast which used to be quite special has now become appalling The cups and saucers have gone to be replaced by the standard holiday inn mugs The magnificent buffet has gone and replaced with meagre pre laid fruit dishes and not a lot of choice of any thing else There used to be an omelette area that s gone too For warm food you have to choose off Theo Randall s Italian breakfast menu at mouth watering prices If the food we had was a reflection don t even bother The fried rosti tasted like a brick Service too was underwhelming forgotten orders wrong orders etc and the experience all in all very poor If this is IHG s flagship hotel in London then unfortunately the 5 star experience they want you to have in the rest of the hotel is not matched by the breakfast I guess it has been done to make more money with fewer costs Go across to the Serpentine caf for a better breakfast Also there are also currently no toilets on the ground floor except those at the back of the restaurant above which involve a flight of stairs for both gents and ladies So beware if you are not so mobile We will pack our bags and move on to other accommodation next time in London in the future,0

The location is fine if you re driving or getting a cab or Uber but as a pedestrian it s a nightmare if you don t know that area There is a metro station nearby but it is really hard to reach it you need to do a huge detour to be able to cross the high traffic streets around the hotel Or maybe there s a secret passage that I missed who knows In any case after walking 10 minutes I felt stupid and just called a cab instead of taking the metro,0
 The walls are VERY thin two nights I was kept awake by noisy neighbours ,0
 Everything was wonderful but it was just a little out of the way for us,1
 Best location for Covent Garden theatres restaurants and the south Bank and its attractions are a short walk away I ve never slept so well the beds are great willy wonka afternoon tea a must all the staff are helpful and friendly will defiantly be back ,1

 room was on the ground floor named club room indeed good in size but with strange dispositioning of wardrobe hairdryer ,0
Attitude of some of the reception staff particularly at check in Studio was smaller that I expected It came with a kitchenette but it was a squeeze to make a cup of coffee Also fridge space could just about accommodate a 2 litre milk bottle Not enough toiletries provided for a family of four Two tellies provided but acoustics made it impossible to use both at the same time There seemed to be a time lag and echo between the two sets Had to wait ages for sofa bed to be made up on the Friday and Saturday night Not good when trying to maintain a routine for young kids Steam room and sauna area needs to be cleaned more regularly Lots of hair lying about and robes were tiny Also black algae in our shower surround Had to repeatedly get key card reactivated Room was showing signs of wear and tear Faucet tap was loose Mirror was cracked Worst of all was the stench from the drains This was stifling some times usually at night,0

 The room was ridiculously small considering it was advertised as a superior double I couldn t find and information on what the hotel offered A tad run down and dirty The area a bit gritty but close to a tube station ,0
Size of the double bedroom makes it not too roomy for 2 people The 2 beds were basically set as one king size bed which is not good if you don t want to sleep next to the other person,0

 Staff very friendly and helpful location perfect for getting anywhere we needed to go in Paris and decor of the hotel was cool ,1
On arrival we were given a basement room where there was no mobile phone reception and wifi also poor because it was underground and attitude of reception staff was v rood and not helpfull at all despite I was with family no adjoining rooms were not allocated even after the request reception staff flatly refused and they always refers to talk to booking com However we were given 2 rooms on second day due to pressure Most dissapointing part was the attitude of staff male and female both were rood Sujith,0

 When we booked the photos saw a couch in the room our room didn t have one Actually this was not a problem I prefer to have more empty space Also there are no smoking rooms in this hotel and while this might be great for most visitors since I am travelling very often to London it will be a problem for me during winter months ,0

 All pretty standard Free Phone Toiletteries and fruit bowl Two minute walk from car park and tube station ,1
 Room was amazing and access to tv movies music our lil kitcen area too ,1
 Spa facilities were disappointing,0
The staff at the bar was not really qualified WE ordered a bottle of Prosecco but instead of pouring the first glass as one would expect the just left informing us 10 minutes later that WE would need to pay as they are closing We got a room in the basement which is considering the price I would have liked to know prior to my stay,0
 The room was a bit small but you d get over it as you d spend little time in the room with all the stiff you be doing around London,0

The breakfast could have been cheaper ie included in the price We were with a party of 17 there wasn t any negotiation on the price,0
 Wi Fi does not work very well ,0
 The cupboard where the hairdryer was didn t open all the way around making the mirror on the inside impossible to use unless you leant across the table Not a big problem just poor design ,0
 Clean an tidy but rooms walls are dirty and scratched room were small check in was late and hotel stuff didn t feel brothered about it so at end of oure trip I m not happy about place were I stayed in But location is really good ,0
Breakfast could have been better coffee was very poor on the 3 mornings,0
 Everyone was very welcoming room was lovely bed was the best and great location After having received a call to make sure we had organised ourselves for Christmas Day lunch we decided to have Christmas lunch at the hotel which was good value Very nice touch Thank you,1
 Very comfortable bed with two kind of pillows one higher and one lower that suit different need in our family The hotel has a inside garden beautiful English style where you feel relax with a glass of beer It s very close to the Earl s court station but still loated on a quite street you can keep the window open while you sleep during the night We like this hotel ,1

 Too busy at reception no room service,0
 Building is old and has a very small lift however great staircase ,0
I made the booking on behalf of my 18 year old son I am concerned that having booked in advance and paid in full for the room on my visa debit card at check in my son was asked to re pay on his card and that I was to be refunded This practice is unacceptable as it is only by chance that my son has a card and also as a student there was enough money in his account to pay for the room Having to make this unexpected payment caused limitations and cash flow issues for my son I had purposefully booked and paid in advance to avoid any complications In my mind there was to be nothing for my son to do except check in and enjoy his room prior to handing to Heathrow airport the following morning Please advise why this occurred and why this process is employed The reimbursement of my original payment is exceedingly slow It should be instant as monies being held for a period of time from both my son and myself is inadmissible Helen Jackson,0

 Rubbishy A C we stayed in winter and were rather uncomfortably warm I would say that the system could do with an overhaul prior to hotter months Appreciate that lower Windows cannot be opened due to height of hotel and local noise traffic etc however there were no risk upper Windows that might have that facility if a c is an issue,0
 Everything was great the service the rooms location ,1
 Friendly staff Comfortable big rooms ,1
 Room should have a fridge for fresh milk and soft drink storage Soft drinks and better biscuits should be provided in the room,0

 No milk in room and called to say late check in and told at check in that my booking was about to be cancelled if any later ,0

This hotel was fantastic I even asked for a large mug as I drink lots of herbal tea they found one in staff room The location is first class amble down Qeensway early evening very eclectic and vibrant We seen every sight there is to see and more within a 5 to 25 tube ride Gave us an upgrade as we were on honeymoon Now please remember its bang in the centre of the area you need to be I have seen comments about room sizes being to small remember it s central London The room was great shower brilliant a large head shower Can t say enough good things about the property or staff 5 plus the decor stunning I am in the travel industry this is the best at the best you will find so read this then hit book no money upfront either in case your itinerary changes Thank you for a wonderful 5 days Oh buy an Oyster card 6 60 per day unlimited travel tubes and buses,1
 The bathroom was very dated and in need of minor repair,0
No Negative,0
 Location excellent,1
 Despite being a superior twin room the room was so small that the beds were pushed together like a double bed The hallway was being decorated on our floor which meant decorating sheets and paint smells although they did seem to finish in just one day ,0
 Noisy air con small uncomfortable bed average breakfast the whole hotel was over priced,0
 To be honest nothing ,0
 The offer I booked was good value the wine and chocolates were a nice element the hotel was in a good position and the hotel was clean and well laid out The staff were all friendly and helpful A good selection at breakfast but some elements were poor quality,1
 Heating system in the room didn t work properly No blanket available,0
 Didn t like the restaurant as tables were too close together And the pillows on the bed were very soft ,0
 They claimed they had a boiler problem and hence could not honour the booking They said they will provide rooms at another hotel which was their sister concern also called Grand Royale and equally good but sent us off to Shaftesbury Hotel where we were asked to share one room for three persons for the first night The second night we were transferred to two rooms but they were so tiny we could not even open our suitcases plus there were awkward steps to get in and out of the room That hotel did not even have a restaurant except for breakfast After much complaining we were given a better room but nowhere near the rooms shown for the Grand Royale It appears that the Grand Royale London Hyde Park is used to attract bookings on booking sites and then people are sent off to a much lower standard hotel In my opinion they are confidence tricksters One guest had evened called the police when we were there in the lobby for the same reason The hotel was not shut as other guests were given and stayed in rooms Since I was with family and had a lot of luggage we had to lump it as it was already night They killed the joy and ruined our holiday ,0
 the location and surrounding environment is dirty and near the rubbish station ,0
We were put in a basement room which certainly wouldn t have classed as a 4 star room How ever it was clean and bed was comfortable,0

Breakfast was cold and 4 extra for my boyfriend to have eggs benedict meaning his breakfast cost 22 and he didn t eat off the buffet,0
 Building work is being done but it doesn t case any hassle ,0
No Negative,0
 I really don t understand how this hotel has a four star rating My room was very small super dark and it wasn t the cleanest hotel room I saw No drinking water in the room or fridge Staff is not at all friendly or hospitable they asked me to pay the day BEFORE my check out like I was a thief or something similar and I felt very uncomfortable about this I travel for work every week and I have visited hundreds of hotels and honestly this was the first time I felt this way The location is excellent but it is possible to find much better options at the same cost or even cheaper ,0
 Location is fairly good,1

 We were promised a room with bath and kitchen but did not get this There was no kettle even in the room until we requested one We chose this hotel which was not really as convenient as we would have liked specifically for this reason On complaining we were offered our last night in the room we had requested An offer we did not take as it was too late to pack and unpack for one night ,0
 Overall very happy with the Room just the Bathroom fittings were tarnished ,0
 Hotel bar very nice place to have a pre drink Very friendly and helpful staff,1
 To say something the wardrobe in our room was very small ,0

 Location close to Westminster bridge was a bonus,1
small room sliding frosted glass bathroom door which didn t give much privacy when using the toilet Contents of mini bar were too expensive breakfast at 15 a ahead is too expensive No natural light to room as window looked out to internal space,0
 Lovely hotel ,1
 Infact very old Wndows at the front not shutting down properly The sink in the bathroom was leaking ,0
The staff were excellent all round and very happy to help you with anything always said hello The doormen were particularly good and the overall level of service and friendliness was the best I have had Loved to be able to open the windows fully as it was very warm and opening the windows enabled a pleasant comfortable sleep Excellent position from tube station I deal 24 hours shop across the road Lots of places to eat breakfast around the hotel,1

Everything was amazing we were very happy and pleased and would definitely go back again Also we arrived at 12 34am due to delayed flights all day and the Apex staff at the concierge gave us a later check out time,1

 The room came supplied with utensils should we wish to have our own breakfast in the room after not including it during our stay,1
 The bathroom and sofa are so good The building style is really awesome ,1
 when you take a shower the whole floor is in the water problem with opening the garage door curtained window some construction,0
 Dinner in restaurant was okay but little too expensive also breakfast was quite expensive many caf s around can t recommend Garfunkels near St Pauls quite far from underground if carrying a suitcase but bus stop in front,0
 The lobby is very nice and the proximity to both the Queensway and Bayswater tube stations cannot be beat ,1
 Bed was so comfortable didn t want to get up,1
 Location near Earls Court underground was great Newspapers and TV stations were good View of gardens was nice lots of choices in the buffet nice to have a mini fridge in the small room ,1
 The hotel was having building work which was not advertised there wasn t noise but it wasn t as beautiful as expected due to the works The rooms were also very small,0
No Negative,0
 Room is very clean good facilities ,1
 Rooms were not as advertised Although clean and well maintained rooms were a bit run down Rooms were very small for the price Hardly room to dwing a cat Management were not responsive to requests for change Had the feeling of being conned ,0
 Bed was really comfy easy to access tourism areas using public transport but quiet area ,1
 See above,0
 Room not set up well for using mirror at desk for make up hair as poorly lit and too far from sockets to use blow dryer provided in room Since staying over for a night out with friends these little things would have been nice ,0
 The bathroom in our room was a black glass box It theory it s cool in practice it leaves a lot to be desired Little privacy not enough light at the mirror and the shower leaked into the hall It did however allow for a loft space with a desk chairs and a second tv ,0
 Everything was good from the staff to the cleanliness And was near to everything we wanted this is the third time that I d been here,1
 Location first and foremost Lovely gardens ,1
 The room was incredibly noisy pipes clanking all night I hardly slept at all,0
Didnt like that although featured in promotional pictures there was no way the London Eye could be seen from anywhere in the hotel Also that the bathroom sink was blocked The burgers we ordered from room service came with no condiments No Ketchup in the burgers or as compliments and that it took room service another 25 mins instead of the couple they promised to brings some by which time we had eaten the burgers to prevent them getting cold Very Poor Also the pasta in the Italian restaurant was poor and our we were given an additional dish we did not order,0
 We don t like the open concept shower It gets very messy on the whole bathroom floor especially if you re not used to it Not a huge fan of the see through bathroom concept when you can see your friend using the toilet whilst watching television it is cool to watch tv while in the bath though The hotel room was otherwise very nice ,0
 Breakfast was poor quality for the price paid a better more satisfying breakfast could be had at half the price at a cafe outside the hotel ,0
 Amazing room Perfect view and lovely helpful staff ,1
 Lovely quiet hotel comfortable with friendly staff ,1
 Inefficient staff but friendly ,0
 Could not find our booking on arrival eventually found not listed under my surname Chaos leaving luggage as early check in was not actioned Lots of fire doors to get through with luggage to room Key card to door faulty and had to be reprogrammed ,0
We were 2 parents and child The added fold up bed was positioned where you would expect the fixed bed to be and vice versa The elevators seem to be insufficient for the large number of rooms When checking out it was very difficult to actually make it down to recepcion because every time the elevator passed it was already full with people And no matter how nice a hotel might be when it s time to go it s time to go,0
 Staff very helpful,1
 Lovely shower,1
 The last time I stayed it was a disappointing room and the breakfast used small plates Now back to the normal standards,1
 The first room with a king size bed we got had incredibly loud floorboards and no bath we then switched rooms to a twin suite which was much more satisfactory The view many had complimented was rather underwhelming and this from the fifth floor ,0
Location service and hotel atmosphere amazing Gym looked excellent but not used Five star Checked us in early 11am was fantastic and accommodated us when we were late for breakfast excellent service both times,1
 Every thing was nice,1
 Some of the furniture was very dated and needs replacing I didn t like our club room being situated in the basement ,0

 Bed was uncomfortable No robe and slippers Room service drinks were expensive and served in the most tiny glasses Water should be in the room on arrival Some biscuits with the tea facilities would be a nice touch Toast was cold Pizza was substandard Shower can be scorching no need to have a gauge that can raise the temperature to such a dangerous level,0
 Lifts far too small Didn t like having to use lift at Russell Square underground Bathroom very tiny could hardly move Shower screen didn t open so very difficult to use ,0

 The bathroom sink was very close to the toilet therefore lack of room to sit on the toilet properly would be a struggle for a larger person especially a male to sit on in comfort Also lack of mirrors light in the room a nice dressing table chair but no big mirror light to get ready in front of ,0

 Beautiful exterior and immediate interior ,1
 I booked one double room for myself and my husband and a twin room for my daughters The girls room was lovely and spacious giving them great comfort whereas ours was rather cramped with a small bathroom and not much space to get in and out of the door once our suitcase was on the case stand I also felt the wardrobes were not deep enough to fit suites in without the doors staying open This was even more restricted by the ironing board being located in the wardrobe too ,0
 No gym and breakfast staff were less friendly ,0

 Ridiculous service charge at bar even though you go to bar and get your own drinks and take them to your own table Reason being that waitress did not understand order for bottle of wine even pointing it out on menu ,0
 Fantastic hotel very close to West End theatres but hidden away on Fleet st so nice and quiet Beautiful room ,1

We were given a tiny room where we could hardly move and tiny bed for two pearls we asked to be changed and we were given one slightly bigger but next to the breakfast room very noisy even at 6am besides the door of the bathrooom was sticky and I told them but never cleaned it The bathroom was like a box where one could hardly move inside and the shower as well they wouldn t make reservations for the opera and if you call a taxi there they send you cars with their own prices which were a rip off,0
 Room was clean,1
 Had to go to another hotel,0

 All minor issues The location of the room was good however I did expect to have both a shower and a bath in the room When we checked in we had a choice of either bath or shower not both which wasn t a massive deal There was also a note to say what was complimentary however there were a few of the items missing Also in the morning three times our door was knocked for the room to be cleaned well before check out time One opened the door to come into our room while we were still in bed sleeping ,0
 Great location near Earls Park underground,1

 the bed is not comfortable the breakfast is always crowded limited options opposite to what was mentioned we had to wait for in long ques for a table for breakfast sometimes we were offered to have have breakfast in conference meeting rooms in another floor so as not to wait we were told that the breakfast is the same which was not as there was items in the main restaurant but not where we had our breakfast however they played cartoons which was amusing for the kids ,0

 The staff were fantastic from the first minute we are a young couple so on first thoughts we didn t think we would fit in but we were treated exactly the same as anyone else the door staff were friendly and enjoyed a laugh as well The room as lovely although the shower wasn t the best it did what we wanted The location couldn t have been any better we were a tube station or two away from everything we wanted we highly recommend this place perhaps we will visit for another birthday next year ,1
 staff extremely friendly,1
 The hotel lies within minutes away from Big Ben and London eye Waterloo station is the nearest underground station and it will take you anywhere you want in London Perfect lacation ,1
 Doorman and guests standing at the entrance smoking made it hard to get in and out Also once the sofa bed was up fro the three of us it made the room very very small ,0

 The bathroom was awful there was a shower a bath and a hose and you got absolutely soaked trying to select the right one something needs to be done about that Also the sink tap was loose and rattled around in its socket and the bath when you sat in it was really difficult to get out of as it was lower than the floor level and you needed a step ladder to get out Also the photo bears no resemblance in any way shape or from to the room I was given no superior twin beds just two ordinary single beds with no gap between them at all I wont be going back there anytime soon,0
 Small clean hotel Great location very convenient Staff friendly and helpful ,1

You When I booked with your company on line you showed me pictures of a room I thought I was getting and paying for and then when we arrived that s room was booked and the staff told me we could only book the villa suite theough them directly Which was completely false advertising After being there we realised that you have grouped lots of rooms on the photos together leaving me the consumer confused and extreamly disgruntled especially as its my my wife s 40th birthday present Please make your website more clear through pricing and photos as again I didn t really know what I was paying for and how much it had wnded up being Your photos told me I was getting something I wasn t Not happy and won t be using you again,0
 Great location close to the underground Staff were very helpful and lovely to deal with,1
 No view we looked right into the back of waterloo station But we were not in that much to look at the view so it was nt really important We did not have breakfast as it was very expensive which was a shame ,0
 Park grand Kessington is easy to go museums and parks ,1
 The bed was extremely uncomfortable The mattress is very soft to the point where if you aren t sleeping in the middle of the bed you might fall off of it I woke up with back pains as well We ended up switching hotels because of it There was no dresser to put your clothes in which was also kind of a bummer Other than that the hotel is old so if you like something modern it s not that Personally that didn t really bother me ,0
 Looks and feels old and cheap,0
 Small grumble We had the afternoon tea However there was a special reception in the lobby bar in connection with the BAFTAs so we had to eat in the general dining area I think we should have been told that when we booked Then we asked if we could chose where we sat and were told no as certain tables were reserved for regular diners No one sat at any of those tables the entire time we were there ,0

Being a club Carlson member and having upgraded the room on arrival for an additional 60 total of 240 to include breakfast and a view I would have expected more than a pair of slippers No dressing gowns only three tea bags only two tissues in box in bathroom and a duvet which only just covered the bed On arrival at breakfast we were told we had not pre paid and subsequently seated on a table totally surrounded by other tables guest bags etc so you weren t able to get out without inconveniencing people by asking them to move No explanation of how the buffet worked and no offer to top up tea This is a shame as we have stayed here on a number of occasions previously and experienced fantastic second service,0

 Nice room nice common areas good door staff friendly check in ,1
 The staff at the restaurant should be more attentive,0
The room was very very small so a couple with 2 medium suitcases is not very easy to move around in the room The breakfast is a basic typical hotel breakfast I would expect a little a bit more than that,0

 I paid in advance on arrival and was disappointed that I was not advised that I could not charge our meal to the room Would have been better if I had been asked if I wanted the facility to charge to the room although not a major problem The message light on the phone continued flashing all night although there were no messages We couldn t get it to turn off so just moved the phone so it wasn t annoying ,0
Got charged 50 for a birthday package when it was advertised for 30 on the website This was apparently due to city taxes which we were unaware of The shower was blocked and would flood the room after one use We were unable to get rid of the water so couldn t use the room after we d had a shower Couldn t check us into our room at 3pm had to wait extra 30 minutes Standard Breakfast was very expensive at 17 I highly suggest not to buy Cigarette machine was broken and staff still allowed us to try and use Overall a disappointing stay for a birthday weekend,0

 The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were really plump The bathroom was a descent size and the shower was especially good due to its size my wife and I also had food in the restaurant my steak was full of flavour and cooked to perfection and my wife really enjoyed her salmon I passed this view on to the chef because I think in England were to quick to complain and don t compliment very often The whole room was nicely decorated ,1

 Bedroom was very small a foot between bed and wall window It was also very uncomfortable Everything was small shower area towels etc On arrival they tried to get me to move to a sister hotel ,0
 I was disappointed with both of the rooms I booked and not sure if I would book again because of this They looked very tiered and in desperate need of a revamp The photos online are misleading of the bedroom and the bathroom was also poor also there was a leak on the stares and had buckets out catching water ,0

The staff at Park Plaza were second to none Our group of 3 were celebrating a friends 40th Birthday and I had emailed ahead to ask of they could assign us a room with a view studio apartment Upon our arrival we were given a lovely welcome our room had a great view of the London Eye there was a card for the birthday girl even a happy birthday written on the window The room was clean and a good size for 3 Breakfast was lovely plenty of choice friendly staff Would thoroughly recommend this hotel did not dissapoint in any way,1
 Although it wasn t an issue for me as it wasn t vital there was no instruction to operate the TV and the provided Handy device ,0
 Maybe a bit more choice for the breakfast but you already have eggs as you want them ,0

Booked in October for a better deal and found that on the night of staying in January it was around 20 cheaper Staff unhelpful when informed basically couldnt care less Rooms were far too small as was the bathroom which had rusty nuts on light fittings and hairs on cups and in bathroom Back of bathroom door was very dirty Very disappointed so went elsewhere for breakfast Definitely won t be staying again in this very tired hotel,0

We actually stayed at Grand Royal Hyde Park as there was a problem with the boiler at Paddington one To make up for transfer they gave us free drinks while we waited for the taxi they gave us and gave us free breakfasts at the Hyde Park It was a beautiful hotel ornate turned wood stained glass windows beautiful painted ceilings like being in Rome the staff were polite happy to help and give us information looked after our bag on checkout day until we left London at 7pm Breakfast was in a beautiful large room plentiful full cooked or continental fresh croissants anything you could possibly want The room was very comfortable complete with kettle and fridge and wardrobe View wasn t great overlooked an alley but it was light and quiet no street noise All manner of shops and cafes and the tube just around the corner And Hyde park 50 metres away I would definitely recommend this to others,1
Location and breakfast were very good overall should be 8 5,1
 They didnt recharged some things like water earpick ,0
 Poor selection of English Beers in the bar Evening meals had to taken in the bar area English meals more than double the price of Asian food ,0
Needs a bit of TLC but overall a very nice hotel Noisy aircon generators outside the room View was actually of them but it is London and we paid around 169 for just bed no breakfast which in London is reasonable,0
 Slow check in Housekeeping takes too long to finish rooms Bathrooms are tiny,0
 Can t recommend this place enough and I visit London every month Fantastic friendly professional staff impeccable service Nice quiet rooms comfortable beds Room service was quick and good Bar is perfect for a work coffee or an evening cocktail There were lots of nice touches from the call just after arrival to ask if there was anything else the hotel could do or provide to water at turndown to the ziplock bag which appeared in the bathroom the night before checkout The pool is lovely no chlorine and just the right temperature But above all it s the staff one of the best run hotels I ve ever seen ,1

 The breakfast area and food was very poor for a four star hotel it was all selfserving so the cooked breakfast was luke warm where u eat had s caffeine feel about it this is very poor for the money,0
The room was noisy at night either because if the water pipes or air conditioning People would also stand in the corridor and have loud conversations outside of my room not the fault of hotel just rude people I had the compact double room and it really is compact Wouldn t recommend for 2 people I m not a tall person and my feet were hanging off the bed Shower was very small but convenient if you want to use the sink sit on toilet and shower all at the same time I didn t but it s possible,0
I stayed for 4 days on the end of November Staff was nice Room was clean and good as i asked for a window with good air because i have severe dust allergy and i m very impressed The breakfast by room service was good and on time Bus stop and subway aren t far from accommodation It s valuable to stay in Paris If i came back which I will i ll stay in this accommodation again,1

The value rating vs money that you get cannot be acceptable for a 4star hotel We were given a room for a single that the adjective tiny does not represent how small it was transformed to get a couple In a 4 star hotel that is far from acceptable After complaining twice since the first time they got us another tiny room we finally got the expected room The images of the hotel s rooms are far from being the real deal A disappointing experience,0

 Staff friendly room nice but a bit small ,1
 The only complaint unfortunately was the restaurant area which is nowhere near enough to cater for the number of guests breakfast in particular where the queues at peak times are huge and led to us missing breakfast our second day which we d paid for The warnings are very clear to be fair to avoid peak times but this isn t really the point everyone should be catered for correctly and be able to choose when they want to eat ,0

In our own experience First night we couldn t sleep due to an extreme hot problem caused by the AC The next day we were moved to a better room ok but I was expecting to be refund for the night without proper sleep and we didn t AC was very noisy also in the new room And last At reception you will be told that reserving a taxi to the airport will cost 44Euro After doing so the taxi driver eventually charged us 55 Euro The driver simply said not responsible for promises from the hotel reception Be aware of that if you wanna use taxi from Arena,0

A lot of reviews talk about feeling threatened or intimidated by the area certainly if 10 year old girls and old women begging scares you avoid St Denis is not the nicest of places but convenient for what I needed Avoid the scrambled egg truly awful but good selection otherwise for breakfast I and others took food away for later and no comment was made by staff Take coffee with you not a lot by the kettle,0
 Minor issue was the room being far from the lift But we re young and need the exercise,0
 Location ,1
 location was terrible it is across the road from a city of tents of homeless people the room was like a sauna when asked if the air con was broken we were told the only use air con in summer the staff were the opposite of a rae of sunshine Especially one lady that was incapable of smiling I felt very unsafe here and chose to take taxis into Paris and to train stations instead of walking with my family even the taxi drivers would say oh that part of Paris is not very good ,0
No Negative,0
 Very little,1
 Requested a quiet room in advance and this was confirmed at reception unfortunately our room was on a gallery and overlooked the lift area from which banging occurred at night and day but not so noticeable then The noise seemed to be produced by the counter weights on the glass fronted lifts Apart from this very annoying interruption to our sleep everything else was good Have stayed here previously but not in this area of the hotel ,0

Fitness club was out of order which was the only reason I booked this particular hotel for the price The staff were vague about the situation and it never got fixed during our 5 day stay And there are no parks nearby for running There were some strangely quirky aspects to the room layour that didn t make sense like a shower with no door or curtain which left an inch of water on the bathroom carpet There was no drain in the floor and all of this meant we could only take baths all week,0
Me and my husband stayed for three nights and felt so happy with this hotel The location is only 10 minutes walking from Luxembourg RER Station and also surrounded by fancy stores mini market and some interesting places e g Palais du Luxembourg and Odeon Theatre The room itself was a bit small but very clean and comfortable The best thing about the room was the view We asked to have a best view room when we checked in and the staff gave us a room on the 6th floor with stunning view of Eiffel Tower don t worry be happy they have an elevator Another good thing about this hotel was its short distance to a good Indonesian restaurant named Indonesia Really worth a try please google the location for details,1

 I think this may be a London thing judging from other reviews but the rooms and corridors are tiny think small and take away another foot In our room the window didn t close properly the heat didn t work and the bath did not empty when you took a shower Very dated apart from the TV If like us you intend not to be in your room much the hotel is adequate but would I stay again not if it was free is the answer,0

 Room did get very hot during the night had to get up to put on air con Wifi is not super speed as stated in fact I couldn t log on at all for our two night stay ,0
 Entering the hotel involved crossing an open courtyard and negotiating a number of steps As it was raining when we arrived we got wet and it was uncomfortable having to carry suitcases up and down steps ,0
 The breakfast buffet had a good selection ,1
 Front of house staff efficient and friendly Room clean spacious and light Microwave was great for heating a snack etc ,1
 I had to ask for the room to be cleaned Wifi never worked in room ran very slow,0

No Negative,0
 The staff on arrival weren t clear in fact one told me my booking wasn t with them and I was at the wrong hotel Also at the time of booking i d been informed the room was paid when in fact it had only been reserved the staff were quite rude handling this situation When I got to my room I called for room service as I was shattered I was told by a member of staff that I couldn t order anything as the kitchen was closed she was rude in the manner in which she said this and this ultimately left me feeling frustrated I went out to grab something and used a plate within the room there was a can opener on top of the plate which was encased in food or remains of something this made me feel sick Someone had obviously not checked the cleanliness of this area in some time Great location staff could do with customer service training I would never stay there again ,0

 Modern and nice,1
 lovely comfortable room and really helpful staff on the front desk Perfect location for our visit to the Globe Theatre,1
The room was tiny we had an upgrade to a club room at check in as it was bigger which was very nice of them the superior double room must have been like a cupboard if this was the case Feel like 160 odd was a bit steep for a small room Shame about the scaffolding on the outside but that couldn t be helped,0
 Modern and well appointed Nice shower Bathrobes slippers in room ironing board and adapters if you forget one ,1
Wouldn t stay here again after all the trouble we had got to the grande royal hotel about half 10 at night in which they said to us oh did u not get a phone call because aparently half of the rooms didn t have hot water in which they offered us a drink and taxi to a sister hotel On arrival here the hotel was no where near as nice and we felt we had been fobbed off a little bit totallly dissapointed we went to our room which was nice and comfortable the only problem was after the first night we wanted room service in bed for our second morning and to watch tv turns out this hotel couldn t even provide us with the basics as the wifi had gone off all the phones had been cut off and the TVs were shut down with no signal on the screen Totally dissapointed I made sure staff where aware on our last morning I took it upon myself when I got to the sister hotel to trip advisor the grand royal as my partner had booked it as a surprise for part of my Christmas present on reviewing these it seamed the hotel since September had been selling the same scam story about hot water issues and plumbing Avoid,0

Rigid rules Our plane arrives in the morning so I requested early check in in the booking Acknowledgement for the request was sent by booking com but no reply or notice from the hotel We arrived and was greeted by a male tall staff with a stern face and harsh tone I started with good morning I know it s too early but I wonder if you ve got a room for us I booked 2 rooms but was just hoping just to get a room first as my father is disabled and he wetted his pants on the way to airport He replied without even looking at me room is guaranteed at 3pm Leave you baggage over there He then started tossing a baggage tag to me and several more The tags are in pairs 1 to tie on the bag and one for us to keep he untied the first pair and literally tossed the remaining 4 pairs to me as I realised it was self service I did the 5 bags by myself and before I could finish he already rushed me to take my tags I can t believe he could be so rude We brought my father downstairs to the loo and got him changed and went out We were so very exhausted and we couldn t help return to the hotel at around 12nn By then we were offered 1 room I saw the lady pulling the file from a stack and I am not sure if there actually were other rooms available already I let my parents in the room and it was soooo very small even by london s standard My bf and I waited at the lobby when we were being stared by the staff like we offended them We waited till 3pm to get our room and of course our room is not next to my parents even though I requested for it when I made the booking and no reply as well And during the check in I had to fill in exactly the same form again with the same info I have absolutely no idea why when the whole booking was made by me myself I understand that they were only following procedures but all these were just very inhuman and inflexible that exhausted guests in every way,0
 Central location friendly impersonal service ,1
 The room was spacious clean and comfortable Bed very comfy Bathroom clean and modern ,1
 Tidy clean room Comfortable bed good air conditioning and nice bedding Nice touch of complimentary chocolates fruit and wine ,1
 Considering the price of the room the facilities are very basic Only enough tea and coffee for two drinks in the room Also the facial tissue and toilet paper were extremely cheap Although I did not require them extra pillows and blanket were not present You could probably request some of the above however I do not think you should have to ,0

 A world of difference between the outward city view facing room and the internal room with its futuristic lift and darkness Ask for the city view when booking ,0
 Room was very small and had a small staircase up to the bed,0
 Extremely small rooms though not surprising for Central London you can barely move within the ground floor rooms Either misleading pictures on booking com or the hotel gave us their smallest rooms knowing we re travelling with children ,0
 I loved the room view cleanliness and above all the customer service and staff was perfect ,1
 The room was smaller than expected but furnished in a way that made it very comfortable and usable I also liked the electricity saving device that turns off all the lights once you leave the room ,1

 The area around the hotel was covered with refugees and homeless While we felt sorry for their situation we didn t feel safe The hotel explained that they wouldn t be harmful to us but taxi drivers police and others around warned us to not walk around with the kids especially with luggage etc We did see a lot of cop activity and fights one evening upon returning to the hotel So this limited our ability to make the most use of the metro there We opted to taxi in most of the time ,0
The breakfast was the hit very nice and worthwhile and the Italian Restaurant is worth a try The beds and room we very comfortable and had a lot of space in for two People room no 723 We slept very well no noise from outside traffic Very pleasant place to stay with Family and tube Station very Close Very helpfull and friendly staff,1
 We were given a twin beds pushed together that kept separating whenever someone went near the middle and also were given a room in the basement had a frosted window so there was some natural light but not able to open it or have a view Asked for both things to be fixed and the staff were unable to do anything except put a sheet over the two beds Staff were generally unhelpful and snooty no information given at check in,0
 The noise from the night club next door Couldn t sleep at all,0
 Staff were very friendly and helpful Location was walking distance to restaurants and tube Lobby was lovely Had champagne we had brought and staff provided ice and glasses in lobby ,1
 The bathroom was tiny you could sit on the loo clean your teeth and enjoy a shower all at the same time not enough room to swing a cat I had to use the public toilets on returning to the hotel to collect my luggage and unfortunately it was down a flight of stairs and wasn t clean it smelled of stale urine not good ,0

We choose to personally take our laundry to be cleaned as it was 1 10 th of the cost of what the hotel was going to charge this was very excessive The room was very warm but we managed by keeping the windows and drapes open,0
 Staff were brilliant so friendly ,1
 Partially frosted glass door into bathroom was both a tad noisy and a bit too sharing ,0
 Fantastic team and very helpful,1
 Good location ,1
 Spacious room with stunning view to the Shard ,1
 The fact that the restaurant shows you special deals but they don t actually offer it you I found the room freezing even after turning air con off and switched to warm and the fact that I paid extra to have breakfast in bed and they only brought my husbands breakfast and forgot my porridge and only came back to say they had forgotten it as we was about to check out so I paid for breakfast as a package and then extra for room service and never recieved it and never got a refund ,0
 Loved the location and the ambiance of the hotel,1
 Good location and easy transport links,1
 Smallish room water pressure in the shower could have been better,0
Arrived a little early for check in and the room wasn t ready they took our bags and said I would be contacted by Txt message when room was available no sign of a text by 1 30 PM so called up to the desk and room was ready room was small fixtures and fittings were poor tap was falling off the sink,0

The booking was done for Deluxe Double room and from 23rd I called them ahead to tell them I will be checking only on 24th Morning I land up to find the reservation was on hold even though they had charged me on the previous day itself Once it got unblocked they provided me a Compact Room where if you walk you will hit a wall When I enquired about the same the staff was unapologetic and started explaining how the Victorian buildings tend to become smaller on higher floors When I was not buying the story they provided me the actual Deluxe Double Room that is more comfy The staffs arrogance and lack of coordination is seriously needs to be looked at During all these commotion that manager didn t even bother to come out from his Palace,0

On my previous visit I had booked a car parking space which was key to my decision to staying at this hotel When I arrived there was a denial that I had made a booking This was resolved eventually but the receptionist to whom I had made the booking came up with some waffle that the hotel had not received the booking until the 16th Dec 2 days after my original stay However my booking had been made with booking com on the 6th Dec so one way or another someone cocked up but I was blamed for the failure in their communication Poor show,0

Breakfast main lounge was overcrowded at 9 00am so had to use upstairs dining area Then there was a mix up over our pre booked breakfast which had to be sorted However after that all fine,0
At 11 at night are bathroom ended up flooded because of a drain issue Somehow the cleaning staff managed to overlook a plastic cup clogging the drain My belief is then that there s no way they cleaned the shower before we arrived Absolutely disgusting,0
 some of the staff were very friendly and helpful Breakfast was very good,1
 The location of the hotel was brilliant the area felt safe and there were shops and cafes with friendly staff Hyde Parks a stones throw away was perfect and a short power walk to Oxford Street instead of public transport The hotel was accessible friendly staff and had good amenities ,1
 View was terrible I booked a triple room but with the sofa bed up u couldn t get round the room Bathroom tiny ,0
 However I did not like how I went into the first room and the ceiling was all opened and I went to reception and instead of doing a room move straight away they doubted my word had to check first and then they moved me plus they knew it was a special occasion so they could be more careful with how they do things,0
 Lovely hotel friendly staff,1
 Every thing was wonderful The only aspect I would add to the bathroom is a magnifying mirror a great help for shaving and makeup The beds are comfortable and the rooms well appointed though a little snug but one has to remember this is a lovely period building in central Paris The breakfast was excellent and the staff very helpful making eggs fresh to order There was fruit in the lobby together with little cakes and umbrellas The reception staff were most helpful providing maps information restaurant recommendations and reservations ,1

 The shower was useless and when it worked it soaked the entire bathroom meaning we had to use all our towels to dry the floor was a disaster The room wasn t cleaned properly in a long time just cleaning round the edges The bed room was up a slight set of stairs which left it very warm because we were along way form the window which left the room stuffy and over heated having to go up and down stairs that were dangerous to the toilet or to get a drink was a nightmare The stairs are dangerous and narrow wouldn t be suitable for older people or kids You definitely get what you pay for It was half clean and not very central,0
 Room was gorgeous and very clean Lovely big bed High quality furnishings and technology and air con as well which was an unexpected bonus ,1

 Some of us found the frequent sirens of ambulances heading for the nearby Great Ormond Street Hospital disturbing in the nighttime ,0
 confusion over breakfast pricing,0
 Staff disorganised Trainee on front desk who was unsupported and unable to check us in Rooms very small and some basement level smelt of stale cigarette smoke ,0
 Nothing I can think of,0
 The breakfast was excellent very fresh contents,1
 yes it is paris style but the room and the elevator seem really too small ,0

 The duty manager was excellent with making us feel feel comfortable Also George gave us good luck ,1

No Negative,0
The room was lovely and modern but some furniture was looking abit tired and I booked a room that said book now pay at property but I was charged on my credit card which wasn t released for 7 days after checking out,0
 the staff were very pleasant and made you feel welcome the room was fantastic big bed and superb bathroom i could not fault anything will definetly stay again next time am in london,1
 Trade off is the room is a bit cramped and the design leans to efficiency rather than comfort The finishes are starting to feel their age in the rooms themselves ,0
 Well Although I liked my breakfast it was not included in the room charge ,0
 We asked the reception to please pick up the laundry we left in our room and placed inside the bag in the morning before we left the hotel However when we got back later in the evening it was not picked up ,0
 Girl at desk was very helpful carina i think was her name changed my room twice to facilitate my needs,1
 They provided a free smart phone for use during our stay including free phone calls to the US It was loaded with maps and dining shopping information Room was clean and very comfortable Staff excellent Quiet location Great pub down the street The Mitre Check out the basement bar there Mary s Place Character and history very cool Close to the tube and Paddington ,1

 I loved the hotels history and its sumptuously embellished original features especially the theatre bar where I met my three guests who had also booked suites with you for champagne to celebrate my birthday and your amazing staircase It was good value for money and Its location was central close to the tube station and perfect for exploring Kensington Gardens and palace and the Royal Albert Hall The staff were very friendly and accommodating and had left me chocolates and a fruit basket for my birthday and did not make a charge for breakfast ,1
 There was an issue with pre payment authorizations however we did contact the hotel directly and they resolved the problem promptly,0
Seems to be good value for money but consider you will have to queue for 20 before to get acc s to the breakfast room never experienced this before Just consider also that you will have to wait circa 7 8 every time you want take the lift Basically overcrowded for the facilities offered Management not present never,0
 Location of hotel is not the best hence the reason there s a security guard,0
 Everything was perfect especially the Italian restaurant where the food was outstanding Everyone were extremely nice and helpful and I mean everyone ,1
 The positives seem to end with the building The staff were pretty rude and dismissive particularly in the bar where it seemed like it was all too much effort to bring the food or take a drinks order The room was freezing and the hot water broke for a period of time The breakfast was in a nice room but again it was freezing and most people seemed to have their coats on ,0
 Sofa bed extremely uncomfortable,0
Bathroom facilities very small and cramped not really suitable for my pregnant wife so larger people would have been very uncomfortable Room a little dated and check in was slow Due to roads being closed around Bloomsbury square car park the hotels suggestion and discounted offer the car park was only accessible by one road which neither the hotel staff or police could direct to 45 mins later we found it Was only a short walk so could be better on other days,0
No Negative,0
 The breakfast was adequate but not fantastic it s probably a good idea to get down early for the breakfast ,0
The room was tiny even by standards for having stayed elsewhere in the U K The room on the 4th floor got too hot and the ac unit did not work neither did the hair dryer so we kept the window open,0
 Check in was difficult and long ,0
 Clean and comfortable Staff were friendly and helpful ,1
 I could not easily control the temperature in the room Instructions on the wall would help ,0
Given location I was expecting much smaller room size but very adequate for the 3 of us Location meant we were short walk from all attractions,1
 Breakfast seemed chaotic the first morning we went to the buffet to get our cooked breakfast when we returned to the table it had been completely cleared the very disinterested supervisor apologised but did nothing in the end we had to go to another table to get cutlery and cups breakfast was now cold coffee did eventually arrive I like hot milk with my coffee which wasn t a problem but in the second morning the hot milk arrived but was quite clearly off it took some minutes for anyone to come close to the table and even longer to get a replacement cup and milk the cup had a huge chip in the rim so yet again we had to wait,0
 We didn t get any Information about the construction works going on ,0
 Great location tube station around corner plenty of restaurants in nearby streets Concierge staff helpful in tracking down an international courier parcel Grandiose decor inside ,1
 Hyde park was nice and it was close,1
 Very welcoming and helpful staff which is so important ,1
The place is completely mismanaged The property is amazing and whoever is running the place is doing it a disservice Don t stay here if you are expecting a 4 star experience it s a 4 star location with 1 star service The restaurant service is the worst I have ever experienced The staff need guidance on how to serve efficiently The hotel has many strange design choices too Had a double bedroom with a friend yet you can easily see into the bathroom shower and toilet Shower overflows all over bathroom quickly You can see into the urinals from the reception area Loud security doors right outside our room woke us up regularly Put the security measures on the elevators ya goofs This is the only negative review I have ever written but the place has potential and needs new management,0
2 minutes walk from Kensignton park and Hyde park About 40 minutes walk from the main shops at Oxford street Staff all very friendly Different restaurants and shops in the street behind the hotel,1
 Sofa bed not very comfortable Breakfast very expensive did not eat or drink in the hotel at all,0
 The restaurant is quite cramped and seemed to be a bit chaotic at breakfast I waited a long time for my pot of tea Then when I asked when it was coming I was given someone else s pot of tea whom had also been waiting for a long time ,0

 not value for money room was noisy very dirty needed serious maintenace cramped with furniture definitely not the room shown on the internet site when making booking we will be telling anyone everyone not to go to this hotel including our travel agency contacts in various parts of the world Concierge didn t even offer to take bags to room on arrival or assist with carrying up the fairly steep entrance stairs interior could do with a refreshment of decor to fit the outside heritage appearance ,0
 Bathroom was basic and dated Shower didn t work well No bin in kitchen area ,0

 The staff went out of their way to help by giving us an upgrade to a room with a view ,1
 Bed uncomfortable too hard probably past its sell by Food drinks very expensive ,0
 Good location Spectacular views Bus literally in front of the hotel backs onto Waterloo station Superior rooms are very spacious Good hardware like huge TV Flexible and helpful staff Beautiful materials ,1

 The building is so beautiful Ans super convenient location,1
Our room was very warm even with A C and didnt have the best view The Mini Bar in the fridge was VERY expensive 3 50 for a KitKat and 5 for a 500ml bottle of water though I guess that the majority of Patrons wouldnt have to worry about the cost of water The Buffet style Breakfast was also a bit of a farce no information given as to whether we helped ourselves gave an order etc and there were lots of children running around Also some of the staff need to be more aware of their non verbal communication,0
 Rooms are little small ,0
The room was great and had a view of the train station A beautiful night view We had a great tapas platter in the bar Doormen where excellent Checkin was fast and easy I requested a late check out the night we checked in The receptionist said to call in the morning a charge of 10pnds an hour I called in the morning at 8AM to arrange the late check out only to be told it was now not ok they need the room After that there were 5 phone calls through out the morning up until 11 30 A little funny they were desperate for this room and we had to experience 5 hang ups through out the morning not relaxing knowing they want you out as soon as possible,1
 Location was just excellent Staff were very friendly rooms a little on the small side but this is to be expected for Paris really Very very good hotel would definitely stay there if visiting Paris again ,1

We booked for a 50th birthday weekend and had a great stay very friendly staff kind and generous gifts left in the room thank you Spotless room with a very modern bathroom,1
 Staff were rude and not very pleasant to deal with at reception I also called in house service for a cup as we were only given one in our room I spoke to a very rude man who told me to call housekeeping but didn t give me an extension number Once I called reception they said they would called in house service but I still didn t receive the cup Perhaps this individual member of staff mentioned above begrudgingly didn t feel it was his duty P Also used the public computers at the reception but the printers didn t work Not much point of them being there in my view or perhaps just do some maintenance In summary great stay and I would stay again but a reminder to hotel that a smile goes a long way ,0

The hotel is located within 15 mins walk to Covent Garden and a shoet taxi ride to the theatre district if you want to save your high heels The British Museum is very close and there is close proximity to shopping and restaurants The hotel has historic links to the Titanic through its architecthe which was of interest to my party The staff were very helpful,1
 Excellent service from front desk Mgr Anna and Vlad,1
 We paid for Internet and the tv kept says No signal so we were unable to use it Other than that our experience was amazing We would definitely visit again ,0
 The double room was just a big single Had to pay for expensive soya milk to use with complimentary tea and coffee Drinks at bar very expensive Extremely high sided bath made using the shower potentially dangerous,0

 The hotel was well situated for a visit to the center of London and was very comfortable I believe the hotel has had a refurb because the rooms are somewhat like a spaceship with wooden panels hiding the walls but it Works The staff were friendly Its a hotel for visitng a city where the room is to relax and sleep but the hotel offers little else other than a coffee and thats what we wanted ,1
 The room was on the small size as well as the en suite Did not see a tip box for the staff as I would have most definitely liked to have given the staff something they were absolutely wonderful which made up for the room being on the small size ,0

 The staff at park plaza were excellent ,1
 Not only did the staff on arrival ask to copy the details of my credit card this is OK but they also noted down the CVV number from the back of the credit card This means that the hotel has all the information to use my credit card for internet purchases Since this is unacceptable I asked the receptionist to delete the CVV but she refused This policy should be changed Otherwise good hotel ,0
 The room was too hot and noisy We could not get the temperature down The carpets in the corridors were old giving a bad first impression The shower very small not normal for this price The bar was more like a waiting room ,0

Only problem was the small bath and the shower head was far to low my husband is 6 foot plus as are many men he has back problems and found ot extremely difficult bending down yo take a shower,1

book the club room which didn t feel like one The first room they gave us was on the second floor behind another random door which held 2 separate rooms The room was not well furnished despite the price paid One side of the mattress has collapsed I called the front desk several times and it was always un answered i went to the reception where they are awfully understaff and waited for a good long 15mins before I could address the change of my room I was told that it was the last room and I can t make any changes I was told to go for my dinner and come back again to see if they could do a swap When I came back they offered me another club room down in the basement with a window facing a neon bright light shinning right into the room every single night Thank god for the curtains The room was much smaller than the previous and reek of a mixture of dampness and new paint I was too tired and upset to even request for another room change,0
 I purchased the breakfast package but there was limited seating and a long line for breakfast We ate there twice and it was fine but I was disappointed not to be able to take advantage of something I had paid for ,0

 Location,1
 Menu and lack of room service at certain times Some rooms are really noisy you can hear full conversations of the people next door There are other rooms where a huge fan goes off outside The building needs better Windows to keep the noise out ,0
 The extra bed was the worst of all,0
 It s modern,1
 I feel the breakfast should be included in the room rate its an expensive hotel to start with ,0
 very convenient location great breakfast friendly staff lovely atmosphere very comfortable beds,1
 Value for money Handy for everything Theo Randall restaurant well worth a visit ,1
The value for place is absolutely ridiculous The price we paid was totally high compare to the standard received I would give this hotel 3stars minus just for the location The hotel charged mi 150 pounds before my arrival without saying what it is for I have of course paid fully for my stay at the time of check in so in my opinion this is overusing my credit card details,0
 The bed was amazingly comfy and huge The hotel was clean and a work of art Amazing and beautiful building Staff extremely friendly and courteous Very well informed and helpful Loved all the retro art deco features rooms tastefully done Would definitely stay again great location ,1
 The two night stay was a little pricey for a relatively small room and with no breakfast included although the room was clean quiet and comfortable ,0
 One member of staff was particularly grumpy but all others were perfectly happy ,0

 Wish I had been given the potted history booklet on registration as I would have had more of an explore ,0
Hotel staff didn t appear to have a good command or understanding of English The receptionist argued that my debit credit card could not be used as a credit card when in fact it had been used as a credit card at Hotel Russell just a week prior when we first arrived in London for the first half of our stay Had to request management to sort this out Her attitude was non too friendly during this experience As mentioned before we stayed here during the first half our trip as well The movie which cost a staggering 8 could not be enjoyed due to the poor satellite reception though the weather was near perfect Room service the first night was acceptable however on night two the food was not delivered When I called to check on the reason I was told that it was after 10 00pm and therefore it could not be delivered The original order had been called in before 9 00pm As if this was not disappointing enough our reservations which I had made on line weeks before the trip was somehow bungled up and when we arrived on Friday we were told the reservations were for Saturday though I had an email confirmation of that Friday being our arrival date We were able to get a room but then had to switch rooms the following morning as the room we were put in for one night was already reserved The location and appearance of the hotel was not enough to outweigh the overall negative experience of staying at Hotel Russell,0
Odd that a posh hotel was pushing adult channels in the rooms Don t people have the internet The dinning room was great but the plastic tables and supermarket breakfast was a let down Staff were not the same standard as the hotel the bar was dirty and always had to get up to ask for things despite there being 3 people behind the bar chatting to each other All in all a great hotel but not well run,0
 The welcome and service provided by the concierge staff was excellent We particularly appreciated the attention and courtesy of Carey and Bernard who remembered us from previous visits and went out of their way to help us and make us feel at home We travel a lot and in our experience those two are in a special class We would come back for them alone ,1
not enough lifts in the hotel had to wait 20 minutes to go down from the fifth floor,0

 Nice view,1
Paid for upgrade to see London Eye Big Ben Eye was fab view couldn t see Big Ben did complain and got half of upgrade fee back if you want to see Big Ben too need higher than 7th floor Also for price we paid would have been nice to have breakfast included An additional 20 a head didn t seem fair when spending over 200 on a room,0

 The rooms were quite small even though we had a club room In particular the bathroom it was really small and the sink you couldn t even get your head near to brush your teeth and the tap that was on the sink was huge ,0
 I loved the overall ambiance and convenience of this hotel The staff was very friendly and helpful ,1
 Restaurant quiet small very busy even at supposedly quiet times for breakfast We had to queue and wait for table as three of us Staff tried hard to seat people ASAP City view was a view of the railway station Not the view I expected,0
 Courtney on the front desk was excellent The rooms were very well furnished big and clean The shower was superb A kitchen area was a welcome plus The hotel catered for food allergies The hotel was close to Waterloo station near Westminster Bridge and the London Eye London Dungeons Sea Life ,1

 Small room,0
 The showers in the rooms are awful not enclosed with just a tap extension on the wall which is too low and the water sprays everywhere,0
Although the hotel is a little from the main centre the hotel itself was outstanding The hotel is currently under construction and expanding its capacity and restaurant bar space I was shocked when we arrived to see a construction site but you couldn t hear any building work from the room and the hotel was impeccable inside Fantastic value for money but I assume once the construction has been completed the hotel will be one of the top places to stay in Amsterdam The bar and restaurant is an added bonus to the hotel and the staff were pleasant and polite The hotel is spectacular and the rooms are modern and very comfortable the previous reviews regarding the bathroom walls are true but we didn t find that an issue I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone especially for the location as many trams lead to the centre of Amsterdam in only 7 10 minutes,1
 Nice room design,1
 No facilities no variety in restrurent,0
Where do i start 1 Horrible location Even though it was walking distance from nearest metro Porte de la chappelle it was a nightmare walking towards hotel as it was flooded with immigrants who have taken over the pavements trash everywhere my family was really scared at times 2 Its not a cheap hotel during hot hot summer i expected proper working air cons We reached hotel about 6pm we went to bed early about 7 30 to be ready for next morning but could not sleep until midnight as it ir con was pathetic We spoke to reception but they knew it and just said they can t do anything 3 Entrance Thought it would be a decent entrance as i have seen in many hotels of same branch but it was just very average and dull and ofcourse with barely working air con,0

 The Saturday evening bar staff were fairly busy and less attentive than usual The air conditioning was very noisy we opened a window to cool the room but then of course there was noise from outside The bathroom was small fortunately we are small people but even so the space is small for even one person I really do not like the glass doors on your bathrooms less privacy and the light from the bathroom is intrusive if someone is asleep ,0
 Room didn t face on to Russell Square but was quite noisy Windows did little to cut out minimise noise Fellow guests were also quite noisy walls doors were quite thin and noise filtered in ,0
They take a temporary deposit from ur credit card to make sure you don t cancel and even after paying cash on checking the keep ur money from your card for a further 8 days after staying which is uncalled for also wanted 20 despite on checking for cover off mini bar of which I refused to pay to find out on arrival off our room the mini bar was empty so why need a deposit,0

When I arrived after 2 days of travelling I was told that my room would only be ready in 24 hours and that I should take a cab to one of their other hotels stay there for a day them repack and move back to the grand royale The rooms are all dirty dust on the skirting boards Rooms are painfully small bathrooms are so small you battle to even dry yourself after a shower Front office staff were abrupt unfriendly and seemed barely willing to assist with calling the manager One of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had in London,0

Maybe not understanding why booking breakfast at Reception attracted a 3 discount Why make paying guests jump through a hoop Fair enough for non guest But the hotel has already collected 130 So not a customer friendly policy does the hotel need the 3 difference that much,0

 Firstly it s located in a bad place Just adjacent to the hotel are makeshift tents most probably of migrant population It feels dangerous to go alone in the streets Facilities were ok As it was located in bad part of city you want to rely on hotels restaurant But this hotel doesn t have an operational restaurant They claim to provide free wifi but for my entire stay there was no wifi Rooms weren t cleaned properly Someone s inner were lying inside my room Toilet is located outside the bathroom and is one of the size to be found in aeroplane ,0
 Room clean big enough staff cool helpful they let us early check in unusual for Paris hotel,1
However when we went up to our room the 3rd bed had not been made up so we had to wait for all the bed linen towels etc to be brought up Restaurant was absolutely boiling Is there anyway that it could be better ventilated,0
Very high levels of service met at check in with a hot towel and a fruit drink and had my bags carried to my room Super friendly and polite staff Good value at 162 actually cheaper than the nearest Premier Inn that night,1

 Often the reality is different from the website but in the case of Hotel George the photos really did portray reality I could not have been happier with every aspect of the hotel I chose this hotel because the average review was amazing This was spot on It s not a luxury hotel but it is a very stylish comfortable hotel that offered interesting little corners like the bar downstairs loved sitting in there before dinner Just a great welcoming stylish elegant hotel where everything just worked Who could want for more ,1
 Very good location and nice staff ,1
Initially we stayed in room 235 We couldn t sleep all night due to the extremely loud noise from the pipes It seems that there is a problem with certain rooms this noise However to credit the hotel when I complained the next morning we were moved to another room which was perfect,0

 Really straggled with the pushchair as there s no disabled access ramp at the entrance and our room was at the ground floor so we had to lift it again ,0
 The hotel is going through renovations and unfortunately it means that the rooms can be less than perfect However the staff did recognise those shortcomings and did everything they could to make the stay as agreeable as possible ,1
 A lovely hotel with friendly helpful staff They went out of their way to stop a light flashing on the phone beside the bed which would have lit up the room every minute otherwise ,1

We arrived at 11 30 and it would of been nice to freshen up from our long journey but we could not get in the room until after 2pm,0
 The upgrade and welcoming members of staff who greated and treated us to an upgrade on arrival as it was a special occasion for us really did make our stay at the park plaza enjoyable and a happy memory Thankyou,1
I had booked a suite and requested a room with a nice view as the trip was for my boyfriends birthday and got a fabulous big suite with AMAZING views of the London Eye Big Ben The Houses of Parliament And also they provided a complimentary bottle of red wine and a card which was a lovely touch Bathroom was lovely with a great large walk in shower The hotel bar was also great which serves food until late if you fancy a late bite with a few drinks Breakfast was also great with a lovely variety of dishes and a perfect start to 3 busy days Definitely would stay here again as it made the mini break extra special,1
Bar Breakfast we had to wait 40mn in the queue Cool system flowing on the ground Family room too small TV couldn t be seen totally from the bed I will never recommend,0
The first impression on a hotel is everything and the front of house staff are first in line to do this i should know ive worked in a hotel for 6 years now and worked my way up from a receptionist to a manager looking over all departments So as soon as we walk in we immediately get what feels like from all of the concierge porters and door staff that we are not welcome all by what we are wearing i know this because everytime we walked in and out of the hotel we got glares and looked up and down and asked if anybody could help us by just stepping towards the lifts They are the first impression you make on a hotel and they destroyed this for us trust me my money is just as good as the people that are walking around in a tuxedo dont judge a book by a cover it also doesnt hurt to smile Im pretty sure thats what youre paid for Also a massive huge thank you to the gentlemen that told us not to get a taxi to the station and get the metro we had been going one way all weekend to waterloo station but he pointed us in another direction you would trust someone in a hotel to know better than you so we turned left rather than right it wasnt sign posted where we needed to go so we got lost for 15mins We finally got to the station running to catch our train from London Euston time we got there we missed our train by 4mins all thanks to a memeber of staff that cannot give directions correctly dont just point next time explain You cost me 230 to get home i sobbed on the platform station all i wanted to do is get home to my baby so thanks alot you can imagine how angry i was another member of staff not really giving a dam about us I was soo frustrated ive stopped myself writing a review for a few weeks Hope you can take this on board and learn your staff to respect and be helpful to all that stay with you,0
 I like the location and the look Of hotel the facilities are nice and the decor is of good quality ,1
 Massive bed,1
 old windows cold rooms and noisy,0
 Breakfast was chaotic queues very long waited over half an hour one of the days were we there restaurant area is cramped and people are seated too close to each other so no privacy for a conversation No where to sit in the reception area Not exactly wheelchair accessible Photos are deceptive as the hotel isn t as close to the London Eye as the photos make out ,0
 Didn t eat in the hotel,1
 There was a resident pigeon above the balcony whose cooing did get rather tedious ,0
 Not a lot really,0
 Comfort of the room is excellent especiallly the technology Sky tv and good quality free wi fi The hotel was quiet within and outside especially if you specify a rear facing room ,1

 A huge disappointment for me was the hotel is going through extensive restoration I booked this hotel after a great deal of research on the basis of staying in a historic building with British charm and character What I discovered when I arrived was the fact that the hotel s lovely exterior was covered in scaffolding the gorgeous public areas you see on their site were closed including the dining room This was not disclosed when I booked and I wouldn t have reserved if I had known in advance They requested full payment on my credit card when I checked in and I regret agreeing to that as I should have cancelled the booking and looked elsewhere So if you are expecting to experience what you see on their website you will be most disappointed ,0
 The bathroom door is semi transparent it s a door that can be opened easily you can hear and see the person inside,0

I was disappointed I emailed and went to no end of trouble to explain what we wanted Everyone was confused However we were told in the end we could upgrade for another 100 00 pound a night which annoyed me We did this as the room we had was dark and too small there was always confusion about things The two tvs were so quiet we couldnt hear them so every time we turned them on we had to call the maintenance man to turn them up which was so annoying In the end they left us with their remote so we didnt have to do it Concierge was very good but depended who was on Breakfast was ok but really really busy Overrall I wouldnt stay again as I would rather be in the middle of the town We had to take a taxi to Oxford St all the time,0
location is the best of all 3min walk to westminster bridge Super helpful staff proper modern star hotel better value than the Park Plaza Hotel opposite to it,1
the restaurant food was terrible my first room was facing the garden construction site which starts at 6am in the morning although per local law is not allowed when I reach the staff he said he could do nothing about it while the construction is actually owned by the hotel it s a real bazaar they can t control it after my insisting they changed my room but the fridge safe and sink wasn t working I stayed there 14 days never again,0

Location great friendly and helpful staff Hotel not 4 star debatable if 3 star however the photographer used to Photo hotel was definitely 5 star bed very basic shower tiny towel almost sandpaper,1

Lovely spacious room Separate toilet and bathroom 3 sinks Divider in the middle of the room Great location for St Dennis stadium and Gare Du Nord Modern Blackout blinds 2 sets of windows so room was very quiet,1

 A little faster check in ,0
 I love to stay at this hotel Staff know me now and are always polite,1
 The rooms were small and didn t have good internet reception The shower door leaked water all over the floor ,0
The hotel rooms are quite small They were clean but in need of decoration The entrance foyer and dining rooms are tired and somewhat dated and the breakfast while okay is expensive if not included in your rate We didn t like the fact that upon arrival we were told we couldn t have the rooms we booked and they were on 2 different floors We booked these rooms over 2 months in advance We were given a complimentary breakfast in compensation but our stay was spoiled by not having the rooms we requested meaning my daughters had to share a double bed I would not rate this hotel as a 4 star it s a 3 in my opinion,0

Overall we had a very good experience The location is quite good 2 min walk from the London eye across the bridge from Big Ben it is very clean and comfortable The staff is very friendly and helpful They literally saved our trip see the cons part Bottom line Very good experience,1
We have come here previously and everything was so perfect that we even decided to stay an extra night so was slightly disappointed with this experience When checking in the staff seems very stressed and busy which made us feel in the way some of the time after waiting for 5 10 minutes to talk to the receptionist we was told we had to wait until 3pm just to check in so was told to come back later so me and my 6 month pregnant girlfriend had to walk around for an hour then return just to get into the room to relax which was the purpose of the trip When we checked in I was asked if I wanted to swipe my card to be used for room service which I did but was charged 25 just for doing so When I asked about this she said it was for the extras but soon found out nothing was included Also we ordered two pizzas which turned up burnt and in the morning the full English breakfast we paid 24 for didn t even have bacon The shower door let out so much water we had to lay down towls to stop flooding In the room there are huge windows which normally would be lovely to look over London but on this occasion our view was the Waterloo train station so spend most of our trip with curtains closed Finally when we was getting ready to check out at 11 50 we had staff knocking at the door asking how long we could be then at 12 05 we had a very pushy woman asking how long we would be as well and with a pregnant woman it takes a while to do that And when it came to checking out we was waiting around 10 minutes just to do so It s very disappointing because me and my girlfriend was very much looking forward to this little get away and now I feel like iv wasted my money and should of went somewhere else I will consider returning in the future but on my trip to London it definitely won t be at this resort,0
The standard room was small perhaps one of the more expensive ones would have been better You literally could just walk around the edge of the bed Breakfast was very expensive We didn t bother just 5 minutes walk along the road was Pret where the price was a quarter as much,0

 The prices in the bar were very high The dinner menu was mainly just pub food The long walk to the bedroom from the elevator ,0

 The location is good wi fi in the room working perfect very comfortable bed tea coffee available any time ,1
The rooms have been renovated to look quite nice and are representative of the photos but they re not at all functional to stay in They ve placed extra furniture items in the room in an attempt to correct this but that just makes the spaces cluttered and not all of the additional items are functional either i e additional robe placed in dark entrance mostly filled up by the ironing board hard to see into damp smell emanating from it and makes accessing room awkward I ended up checking out after one night as I was there for 5 days and had work commitments so ease of use with the room was important to me,1
 comfort of bed,1
The room was on the 7th floor tucked away at the end of a corridor by the staircase therefore quite noisy until late at night The room was the tiniest room that I have ever stayed in and I travel a lot to London and abroad The regular size double bed filled the entire room with hardly any space around it to manoeuvre I literally had to shimmy down the side of the bed to get into it and also in order to reach the bathroom The room was advertised as a superior double but in my experience it was only standard and due to the small capacity and lack of space would be better utilised for single occupancy The photographs within the booking details are misleading,0

The staff here are indifferent and the hotel didn t respond to communication in the lead up to my stay I arrived 4 hours prior to check in time and had emailed twice in the week leading up to staying to ask for an early check in even offering to pay for it after a 30 hour journey from Australia I didn t receive a response and my room was not ready until 2 hours after their advertised check in time I was offered a toilet off reception to use to change and told they would store my bags The toilet floor was covered in urine It was a disgusting and disappointing start to my trip that coloured my view of the hotel,0

Too old building The steps of the upper level sound too much because of the floor material wood I stay at Room 017,0
We were first shown Room 624 which was so small It should only be listed as a single CERTAINLY not as a double But we asked to be moved and they showed us a couple of rooms and one was much better So I cannot fault the service The bathrooms are fabulous best I have ever seen However the pictures on the web site give a very different impression of what the hotel is actually like Very clever photography gives a very false idea of the size of the main areas The bar and lounge areas are tiny and not big enough to accommodate the amount of people that could potentially be staying there We came back in at around 10 30 pm and there was only one space left for us to sit at in the bar area Others came in later and had to stand Unfortunately for us the hotel is being refurbished at the moment so wasn t looking at its best with scaffolding covering the whole building and many features inside were covered up with settees and flower stands removed Which is a shame as it is a beautiful building All in all a nice stay but not a great one,0

As you may have read from other reviews this hotel is not in the heart of town although it s close and you do walk through a less privileged part of Paris It is not far to get into town once you reach Porte de la Chapelle metro station but it is a decent 10 minute walk to the metro in a less than picturesque part of town this may be unacceptable to some people but we managed Let s just say I wouldn t feel comfortable walking back from the station after dark unless I am in a group of 5 guys There are no restaurants takeaway food outlets nearby which was annoying so if you want to venture around Porte de la Chapelle metro station we found a great cheap and nasty pizza place near there Gym needs to have some weights and a bench Aircon was not cold enough for us and we would have liked some bowls and utensils and proper cups vs plastic cups I suggest you look on google earth google maps before booking if you are a bit precious with where you stay,0
During our stay on both mornings we were woken at half 6 each mornig by a high peck noise coming from the pipes in the bathroom when we complained we were told it never happened by for we were given a 15 refund which was 40pound for the price of the hotel it should of been more by sleep on both nights was ruined,0
 Affordable Friendly staff,1
 Good Price Great Location Good side view of Eiffel tower Very Good comparing to my other hotels booked in Paris which usually have very small rooms ,1

Perfect location in South West London Very serene and close to the tube station about 250 meters Many restaurants around and nice walk to Hyde Park Very clean and decent place,1
 Dinner was very average Room was very hot and the a c did not work ,0
 Small room and the slow inprofessional response from the staff for the room A c problem despite complaining three times about it which took them two nights to move me for another room with a properly working A C unit ,0
We checked in early at 10 45 ish and was told to return after 2 pm to get our room key we left our bags and returned about 5pm after a busy day and was told they were still working in our room and it would be another 10 minutes We complained as we had to be out at 6 and they gave us another room but we thought this was really poor,0
 Position Staff at the reception only,1
 Staff were really helpful and friendly Ever such good value for money Top tip would be book direct as same price only breakfast is included although they upgraded us to free breakfast Rooms small but clean and comfortable ,1
 It s not really a bad experience but I did find a pair of socks from the previous guests in the corner of the bedroom There was also an awareness of noise when the outside door was opened and closed so I would request a different room next time ,0
 Nothing really I was very happy with it ,0
 Air conditioning was a problem We had to let them know twice before it was handled Overall we very much loved our stay ,0
 Loved the character and history of the place and the location Loads of great pubs and restaurants mostly Italian nearby Friendly efficient and polite staff ,1
 We had issues with our electronic key everyday It deactivated It wasn t kept near our phones but somehow there was an issue The staircase for our bed was steep and no handrail The tea coffee facilities weren t updated daily And the floor was dusty and had hair on it and that was upon our arrival That situation didn t change Other than those minor issues the hotel was lovely ,0
 Location good Staff friendly helpful Facilities in room good,1
 The room wasn t ready at check in when we really needed a rest We were given a free drink at the bar though which went some way to compensate ,0
 Room very small dark and rather claustrophobic Bed at an angle to fit it in the tiny room Bed pretty small too Room was hot and although window opened it faced on to back of building with all the noisy air conditioning and heating boilers ,0

It was noisy throughout the night because of the central heating boiler being so close to room 116 If it wasn t the boiler it was something else noisy,0
It was needed to ask for 2 hours late checkout I was unwell and outside was a heavy rain weather I thought that they will contact with me to confirm or reject my request I spent a lot of money during my stay I was just asking for 2 hours for free The staff did not call me I thought that they are accepting my request In fact they by themselves cut the money and took some extra money as donation from my accounts with unauthorised way which were impolite and very bad behaviours I was perhaps going to cancel my request or extend one night instead of cut more money for just 2 hours It looked like stolen issue therefore I really would like to refund my money The supervisor did not care I confirmed to her that I will complain she was laughing and showed me her name on her T shirt as a kind of the confrontation,0
 Fantastic staff so friendly and helpful The building was beautiful It was also my sons birthday and he recieved chocolates and cake ,1

Amy on reception was brilliant and went out of her way to make our stay perfect We even got a complimentary cake delivered to our room as we were celebrating our 10th anniversary Thanks to all the staff,1
When we arrived they told as that they didn t have any room available and they asked as if we wanted to stay in another hotel they had We said no we had booked this room 2 months ago At the end they found a room available in the basement with no window etc we didn t accept and then by miracle they found one available on the 6th floor The rooms are very small,0
 Base of shower screen had black mould all over it No flannels supplied,0
 Really grand and impressive building It had the wow factor Luanne and Ankhur were fantastic Really made our trip special They upgraded us for a special anniversary and clearly wanted to ensure our stay was perfect Excellent location Really close to Hyde park and free weekend parking no congestion charge at the weekend either ,1

No Negative,0
I was disappointed that there no sofa or armchir in the room as depicts in the room description The view offices 5 meter from my window The price of room service,0
 Rooms very small having to pay in advance made you feel like they didn t trust you also the fact that no one told us at check in that we had to pay in advance resulted in an embarrassing position when we were locked out of our room On asking reception why we could not get in our room we were told in front of a busy reception area that it was because we hadn t paid I would expect to pay in a YHA but not in a hotel of this standard Ii have stayed in many hotels around the world and never have I had to pay in advance ,0
No Positive,1
 Reception staff incredibly attentive helpful and approachable,1

 The bed was amazing Hotel was spotless and staff were super ,1
 The accomodation was spacious and beds very comfortable affording a good nights sleep ,1
 Need to put more milk and tea bags in the room but I find that problem during most of my stays in hotels The room was clean but there was a couple of hairs in the bath probably from the cleaner I DIDN T make a fuss and just washed them away you could tell the room was spotless everywhere else and it was just a mistake the bath had been cleaned ,0
Cramped small bed Bar understaffed and waiter overwhelmed forgot one drink from order and it too 3 requests 45 minutes and Asking the mixologist directly the get the drink,0

 The hotel brings a high style of modernity and glamour The staff is always ready to help in anything and the amazing location between the turistic and business area in Paris ,1
 The rooms were small and the bathroom was a wet room which wasn t great especially as it was unexpected Also not entirely sure we were given the deluxe double room we paid for ,0
 Smallest room ever stayed in ,0
 Everything fantastic stay at the hotel Enjoyed a lovely nights sleep and quiet Attention to detail superb i am a coffee fan and was pleased too see the kettle in the room was spotless inside not all full of limescale and quality filter coffee bags on the coffee tray which were really appreciated and coincidentaly my favourite type Really impressed with every aspect of this hotel and will definately return,1
 Bedroom was small but to be expected staying in a double room in London if you wanted something spacious maybe upgrade to a delux we didn t and regretted it But overall enjoyable hotel would defiantly return,0
 Superb location starting with London Eye and Westminster Abbey Big Ben and some more within short walking distance Public transportation and train stops also very close Ideal if you don t have much time but want to get as much as possible as tourist Though in the center and recent construction next to hotel but our room was very quiet provided noise cancellation I guess Staff was very friendly and helpful highlighting Magda on reception our cleaning lady Nadia and one member I think Sarah at the breakfast ,1
 The location was excellent for travelling by the underground The staff were very helpful and accommodating to our requests ,1
 Very good staff and service Breakfast food looked good although no Restaurant for lunch or dinner Unique vibe and decor Free wine fruit and chocolate on arrival ,1
 Easy access to trains and transport restaurants and local pub where food was good ,1
 Comfortable location Most of the landmark around there RER elevator is in front of the hotel Most of the bus lines are near hotel ,1
 Seemed very matter of fact at Reception Lacked warmth Didn t like smokers on balcony next to mine ,0
 Room was very tired feeling walls and skirting needed a good sand down and coat of paint Rust damage down back of hand basin clearly visible from toilet ,0
Staff very friendly and helpful Location to Hyde Park brilliant and very close to 2 tube options,1
Waited 30 minutes to check in Facilities on ground floor extremely crowded and run down,0
The staff was very in co operative and the rooms were awful to say the least I was finally shifted to a bigger room but when I requested for check out till 3 PM on Friday the lady told me that till 2 it was okay and she will try for 3 Then she says that she will do it only till 1 and not till 3 No reason was given for this at all,0
 Very cold floors in the bathroom ,0
 location to London tube and bus is not so convenient It is also not convenient for calling Uber cars ,0
 Bar prices but that s London for you ,0
 location staff,1
 Staff and food were lovely,1
 High Tea was very exquisite and memorable Bar and restaurant staff beyond reproach Concierge was exceptional and arranged the best theatre tickets in the house on such short notice The upgraded superior rooms facing Hyde Park definitely worth the price for the added space and views Club Intercontinental the perfect atmosphere and setting for breakfast and cocktails ,1
 Room very small and air con didn t work but biggest problem was the position of the toilet as the wet room shower glass door was way too close to front of toilet so had to sit sideways and even then easy to hit your head when sitting standing,0
 Older style hotel room with dated furnishings Not very spacious for those travelling with larger bags ,0
 Nothing,1
 They are renovating also a good thing ofcourse But the staff did everything to please us ,0
 Cream tea was great Room was spacious ,1

The bar staff didn t explain they automatically added a discretionary service charge to each drink I questioned the price because it was 98 pence more than in the menu The barman was not happy and showed this when I asked him to remove the charge Service was slow and the bar staff were not engaged The bar was not busy at the time,0
 Friendly staff Handy for Westminster and Waterloo ,1
 The location was great,1
 Lovely big room Great view over little park Good breakfast ,1

 The room was very clean and the bed was really comfortable The staff were very friendly,1
 Was nothing not to like excellent hotel and staff,0
The hotel is located 2 minutes away from 2 underground stations so it s very convenient It s perfect for a stroll in Hyde Park as well as you just need to cross the road The hotel hall is very beautiful the building is a period building and the hall and staircase seem to belong in an old period movie We had a club room and it was quite small It had a nice alcove where the wardrobe and desk were but the bed area was quite narrow The bed was small but very comfortable,1
 I loved everything The staff was very nice and gave us a special birthday request Everyone was extremely helpful and I loved the view of the London Eye,1
 Staff are the best of everything they were their every time you need help thanks to everybody,1
 Going back to work at the end of my stay ,0
 The location is really good the room was spacious and comfortable the bathroom as well ,1
The room Inside room with view of the dining room Could not open the window Could not control the air conditioning Was advised the morning after our stay that we needed to ask reception if we needed cold air as it was controlled from downstairs The tap on the bathroom sink was very loose The tap on the bath was very stiff the setting was programmed for hand shower use so my friend got quite a surprise soaking when she tried to turn on the shower and one of the turning spikes handle broke off in my hand when I tried to turn it Could not control the water temperature so ended up filling the bath from the hand shower unit with boiling water and taking a bath when the water cooled down Advised reception of the issues after breakfast and 2 plumbers came up to the room straight away where they proceeded to tighten the sink tap and look at the shower bath controls Both agreed that they were not right They also pointed out that there was no visibility of the hot cold bath shower info on the taps as this appeared to have rubbed off We spoke to the manager who offered to refund our breakfast but not the cost of the room Cannot fault the staff polite and efficient but a little disappointed that no refund part refund was offered The front of house manager gave us his card and advised me to email these details on our return,0
 Friendly and efficient staff lovely room and a fantastic location The hotel even surprised us with a welcoming slice of cake decorated with Happy First Anniversary I nearly cried ,1
The price is steep It is quite luxurious but maybe not 200 a night luxurious,0

 The decor in this hotel is sublime ,1
 Hotel that I originally booked had a problem with the room so they asked if I would mind being upgraded and transferred to another one of their group hotels I agreed and they provided free transportation refreshments in the bar whilst waiting and a great new location Will stay there again ,1

 The rooms were excellent the beds were super comfy Overall this is a really lovely hotel one i am definitely staying in again ,1
 Comfortable bar,1
 Several parts of the building outside are under construction at the moment and getting to the reception required a little search around Also the standard rooms are located towards a rather frequented street which gets very noisy when opening the windows This is rather necessary though due to the sleeping area on the first floor of the room being somewhat stuffy ,0
 nothing,1
 No water in room no fridge insufficient tea making facilities Single bed was inadequate for me ,0
 The best thing at this price excellent price in relation to the modern and spacious room received ,1
We were phoned during the day of our arrival to be told that they had room issues and we were being moved to another hotel After explaining we had a car in a nearby car park and that we had all been enjoying the festival we were at in Hyde Park so could not drive we were told there would be rooms in the grand royal When we did check in we were asked to pay for the room despite the fact the hotel had already pre authorised the full amount which had already been deducted from my card This meant that I was now 600 down for a 300 bill Next came the rooms having booked a deluxe double room we were given a twin club room which was so small that two people moving around the room were constantly having to get on the bed or go into the bathroom to let the other past All through this staff were not very helpful and seemed to be basically clueless Having listened to other people checking in and out and all the other complaints at reception I can safely say I do not believe anyone had a good stay this weekend Very disappointing for a such a wonderful building in the main,0
 Bed was comfy shower a decent size Room cleaned daily ,1
 The bathroom requires minor maintenance repairs attention to the sink plug hole to keep water in and the hand shower in the bath needs attention due to a heavy leak when in use ,0
 Excellent location near Hyde Park Queensway little shops and restaurants rail stations Hotel itself nice and quaint ,1

 The entire staff was exceptional location ideal and rooms comfortable The staff went above and beyond to provide us with every comfort and kindness during our stay In particular Razvon at the front desk was top notch in every way imaginable The accommodations were excellent but Razvon s warm hospitality took the experience to the next level I highly recommend this beautiful historic and gracious hotel ,1
The cleaner knocked on our door at 8am which wasn t ideal We were checking out that day so no need to clean the room Being fussy the dressing gown and towels weren t hugely soft,0

Tea and coffee facilities in the rooms need updating and improving The old fashioned kettle and a hand full of tea bags and instant coffee sachets might have been okay in the early 90 s but not anymore And would it really be too much to ask for a bottle of water or two in a 200 per night room Instead of draining the tap dry in search of something other than tepid water from the bathroom sink,0
 The mattress on the sofa bed ,0
 Everything was ok the place was very clean comfortable and the location very convenient ,1

 This is the second time I stay in this hotel It s clean and bed is calling my comfortable Also the vote is near by earls court underground station and the street is full of restaurants coffee shops and supermarkets,1
The room was tastefully furnished and very quiet I particularly appreciated the deep pile carpets and the individually controlled central heating in my room during the cold Christmas period The windows were well insulated too not something to be taken for granted in England With Kensington Gardens literally 1 minute s walk away it was lovely to unwind after a busy day sightseeing with a walk in the park,1
 We didn t have a bad experience ,0
 I was taken seriously ill during my stay The staff could not have been more helpful and considerate far beyond what I would have expected ,1
 The bath tap was broken and leaked horizontally over the floor,0
 Location was very good for Hyde Park and shops,1
 My biggest issue with the hotel were the other guests Rarely have I spent so much time around so many affected rude and ignorant individuals Yes the hotel costs a few quid yes you need a bit of money to stay there but quite why people feel that makes them better then the staff working there is beyond me The rudeness and arrogance of my fellow guests was almost enough to ruin my stay ,0
 There was nothing that didn t come up to description or photographs ,0
 Staff were very good and friendly Hotel is in a great location especially for theatre and Covent Garden Overall great place to stay in London,1
The rooms are very small we had trouble fitting 2 suitcases in The price is fairly high even by London s standards and breakfast was extra,0

Having paid to upgrade was very disappointed as the bowl of fruit in the room was a plate with a few slices on it and we needed to remind them Having paid for an executive room expected executive service as was told no tables for available for breakfast They told us we would have to wait and only needed a table for 2 not 6 They know which rooms are which and could have given us priority having upgraded so we went out for a hot breakfast On the first day the cooked food was cold eggs bacon and beans the reception need to speak to firm they use for taxis to the station We were told 25 minutes to Liverpool Street it took one hour and five minutes and we had prepaid tickets on the train so could not afford to miss it We had to run to catch the train by the skin of our teeth it would have been expensive had we missed it to pay on the day The fare quoted was 26 we were charged 30 and taxi driver said there was no way we could have got there in 25 minutes I have emailed the hotel manager with my comments to give positive feedback but so far no acknowledgement nor reply Very disappointed overall,0

 Our stay here was excellent from the location to the staff We got the room with a view and it was absolutely amazing you could see the arc so close the pictures don t do it justice This was our first time in Paris and we loved it Farouk went out of the way to help us and book stuff we wanted to do around the city if it wasn t for him the stay wouldn t have been the same he was as good as the view we had Would definitely recommend it ,1

Even allowing for the hotel being under major renovation works the quality of service leaves a lot to be desired Noise of running water coming from the heating system disturbed our sleep considerably No remediation possible Toiletries in bathroom had been used by previous guests Some were empty some partially used Checkout at 12 30 1hour after official checkout time was declined as priority is given to a tour group arriving earlier than normal checkin time Having paid over 300 for 1 night stay this is somewhat disappointing Service at breakfast was very poor Shabby state of hotel with the exception of the rooms is perhaps explained by the renovation works and work still to be done,0
Convenient location near two tube station Very close to the city and all main attractions The hotel is situated in a historical building that is well kept I stayed in delux single room for 6 nights The room is small but it has everything you need Wifi is available in the room and is free of charge good value for money,1

 Lovely hotel in a convenient location in the centre of London Relaxing hotel bar Very friendly staff Very comfortable bed Spacious room ,1
The staff were 100 amazing nothing was too much for them The Hotel was Fabulous and soaked in History and character This was first class hospitality with ano affordable price,1
 The price ,0
 The bathroom was far too small for an executive room The key of my room did not work properly ,0
Your staff did not know where to pool is and instructed me to visit the neighboring park plaza building to be humiliated when I asking if I have my room card and if I am a resident The talk continued for 10 minutes where every service which I originally came for was not available Hence this hotel although modern and pricy is nothing more than a unorganized scam But good job you took my money you are good capitalists,0
 Not really that much of a problem but the bath takes up to much space in the bathroom so it is not so comfortable using the washing basin ,0
 Great Location Friendly and Helpful Staff comfortable room ,1
 Quiet yet very handy location for a number of London theatres including the Savoy Although we didn t use the bar it looked very inviting with the option to sit outside and enjoy the sunshine ,1

 First night we had to stay in an extremely small room They did move us to a much larger room for the rest of our stay ,0
Booked a family room No a c heating working 2 small children Moved room supposedly an Upgrade same problem told by the manager it s because the room has a lot of glass Spent the night in a cold bedroom Not enough towels and poor attention to customer needs A very very disappointing stay will be writing to their head office I still had to pay,0

Two best things about this hotel is that it is extremely near 3 Underground stations and that it was immediately across from Hyde Park,1
Small but comfotable room Very clean Excellent breakfast Good location 5 min to underground station,1
 Unfortunately there was roadworks just outside our window so we were woken up rather early Saturday morning by construction machines but once we shut the window we couldn t hear them Room was also on the small side it was more cosy as opposed to spacious and luxury ,0
 The location was simply excellent The hotel is close to a major metro line and you can reach any part of the city easily The staff was as well exceptionally kind and helpful Loved the hotel style old English style ,1
 Like most London hotels the room is tiny smaller than the photos suggest ,0
Reasonable price with very clean rooms good stuffs About 10 min Walking to Harrods super markets restaurants and the transportation are so close very good location,1
 Location and helpfullness off staff excellent Concierge services helpful friendly ,1

We booked this through a third party booking Com Previously to that I had spoken to reservations of shatsbury hotels which indicated to me you have made a perfect choice for the location and purpose of your special occasion surprise to your partners birthday They also stated this is a wonderful boutique hotel and which would meet your needs for this occasion The lady also stated you can book through our selves or the third party If you decided you wish to book through us you will be offered breakfast included in the price How ever I decided to book through third part as the price was a better rate for our selves I had been in contact with the hotel manager and discussed possible arrangements and touches for my partners surprise On arrival all seemed okay had a coffee in bar why waiting for room to be handed over When entering the junior suite room I was astounded in how poor quality and damage of furnishings also dust and extremely cold as well as the cold feel to the room I unfortunately broke down to my partner and had to apologise I had been let down We then went down to reception and spoke with the manager Sophia and explained our concerns of the room Sophia said I can show you another room but it will be smaller and same quality as we re currently going a new refurbishment as of last week I explained I wish I had been told this before How ever Sophia said I will get you moved to the hotel you stayed at before which is Kensington park grande She spoke to reservations to find out and sort out Thinking everything was under full control sadly it turned in to a disaster of a night mare I then took things in to my control by phoning reservations cut the long story short 2 hrs later still got know where really and by now my partner is currently not good health due to waiting for brain surgery has now got stressed and feeling dizzy and sick We went down to reception and finally the gm Natish took us in to club lounge and spoke to us,0

For a five star hotel charging 450 a night for a room at the very least there should be coffee and tea making facilities,0

second time i ve visited this hotel First time my husband and i were bumped This time when told they were moving me i stood my ground and insisted they gave me the room i d booked Don t trust them no consideration for woman travelling alone You can imagine my shook and horror as 2 gentlemen came to check in next to me and were given rooms without hesitation or treat o f being moved My checking in experience was so upsetting i did not bother asking for help when my rooms heating wasn t working So I froze all night didn t sleep and felt totally upset when asked on checking out if i d had a good stay i said no and explained why Oh sorry to hear that Bye was the response i recieved from the polite but obviously not empowered reception staff Beware of the dubious checking in policy,0

Had a bad experience with room service 45 minutes we waited until we called to chase up then we were told it would be another 15 minutes Clearly they didn t make note of our order from our first call We also paid for late check out until 2pm but were disturbed 3 times by housekeeping obvious lack of communication,0
 Room was very clean staff was great location was great for the tube and restaurants etc ,1

 I paid for a superior room and the room was the size of a small walk in wardrobe The shower didnt have a curtain soo the floor gets completely soaked Their large towels are big enough to dry a young child It was ridiculous,0
 Our junior suite was exceptionally tired A challenging room very noisy and cold not at all restful in any way Wires hanging under the tv poor standard of decoration especially in the bathroom Taps in bath overbath shower very stiff and difficult to regulate No water or hot water on the final day Dirty walls in bathroom Poor recognition of problems by staff zero response Mouldy bread in toast bin at breakfast ,0

On arrival we were able to leave our bag and told our room would be available from 2pm Great we thought that all fits with our plans However this relaxed feeling was short lived When we returned to check in later that day we were met with a long queue that took 40 minutes to process before we made it to the front Only to be told the hotel was fully booked How we wondered could this be we d booked 2 3 months prior to our check in date and received confirmation our reservation had been confirmed We were informed that our booking would be honoured at a neighbouring hotel and a free taxi transfer would be arranged for us within 5 minutes 30 minutes later our taxi had not arrived and we noticed ours wasn t the only one that hadn t turned up So far we had been well over an hour A further 20 minutes later a taxi finally arrived and we were taken to a hotel only a few minutes away Needless to say the other hotel dealt with us promptly on arrival but all the drama at check could if been avoided if only we had been told upfront,0
 The staff so so friendly and accomodating They went above and beyond to find room in the freezer for medications and the concierge helped us on a daily basis ,1

 The room itself was clean and of a good size but lacked in any form of character It felt like a place for business rather than somewhere you would go for lesiure It was a stereotypical hotel room very basic design art on the walls you d expect to be in every other room no character or unique qualities The view from our room was also dissapointing a concrete wall It made the room very dark However not all rooms can have a view and that is understandable In this instance I was after something more romantic but for those who aren t this hotel is perfect and cannot be faulted for its cleaniliness and quality of staff ,0
 Each day breakfast we had to ask repeatedly for a spoon for our coffee Sometimes we had to ask several times Even then sometime we never receive it Not impressive Major construction in front of the hotel It was loud with a lot of dirt and dust being thrown into the air Careful you don t get it in your eye or breath too deeply Everything else was good ,0
 Great location for all sites in London and very family friendly Kids loved the hotel money to spend on ice creams and drinks ,1
 Location is perfect,1

 I loved the hotel and the location The staff were very friendly the food was fab and our room was excellent ,1
 Excellent desk and concierge service gracious and friendly and provided good service Location is right at the Picadilly tube line and easy walking to the Circle line I took the Picadilly tube to Heathrow and avoided traffic to get there I rolled my suitcase around the corner took the lift to the platform and didn t have to move again until reaching Heathrow ok one short stairway That s convenient ,1
 Nice old building,1
This is a wonderful old hotel in a great location Easy access to underground but also with walking distant to most attractions Serge and Bernard made our stay at the Russell very special From the moment we arrived to our departure 3 days later they went out of their way to make our stay at the Russell memorable,1
No Negative,0
The style of the room was unique and amazing with a light room laminate floors and a stunning black bathroom Our kingsize was very comfy and spacious The hotel itself is very beautiful and they have kept the original staircases and high ceilings All of the staff spoke English perfectly just like most people in the city and I couldn t fault them on anything they were always willing to answer our questions and even gave us a map and told us where we could find some interesting places Hotel Arena s location is pretty perfect as it is less than a 10 minute walk from a tram stop to Centraal Dam Square Rembrandtplein and any other places you might be interested in exploring It s also right next to Oosterpark so I can imagine how nice it would be to go to in the spring and upcoming summer Really loved this place overall and a great hotel to stay at especially if it is your first time in Amsterdam as it was mine,1

 Not enough shower gel body lotion etc Also I had to request our complimentary water it wasn t already in the room ,0
Flexibility staff very eager to please Quiet area Near to Lancaster Gate tube and Hyde Park where we had a great morning having coffee and cakes at the Lido Cafe Also enjoyed the traditional London sing song at the Duke of Kendal pub on Sunday night Handy for the 205 bus which took us all the way to Kings Cross much easier than the tube,1

 Despite being in the heart of London but the location is very noisy and inconvenient A lot of people move around super noisy and you would never feel piece of mind on top of that single rooms are very small like a grave I would never stay there again ,0
 Good service friendly and helpful staff Location was nice close to Hyde park Have a few shops and restaurants around the corner Hotel and rooms was clean and well maintained ,1
 To be honest our stay was a nightmare from start to finish We arrived at the hotel to be told that someone had been trying to contact us they hadn t and that we were being moved to a cheaper different hotel when we had picked this one due to its beauty My husband had to complain that we were still being charged the original price and being moved to a cheaper room so we were upgraded but the staff kept changing their mind about where we were going to be staying first telling us to move then that we were staying then again that we were moving We had to complain to get upgraded to a suitable room in the other hotel and the staff were disorganised and slow I am hugely disappointed as this was our wedding anniversary ,0
 The breakfast and balcony of the room are really a big surprise ,1
 Price,0
 This is no fault of the hotel or staff but immediately outside the hotel were people sleeping rough in vast numbers and therefore felt very uncomfortable and unsafe It was at times like walking through a war zone ,0

Breakfast pricing of 19 for 2 ppl was not included in our stay deal Seemed a tad disproportionate and unfair but perhaps London thinks it can justify that price for egg bacon a sausage toast and tea we had breakfast at Giraffe Cafe 2 minutes away very nice,0

 We like the hotel and the staff were very helpful We did have a complaint and it was put right The management went out of there way to make sure we had a good stay and that we were happy The rooms were very comfortable and breakfast was very excellent Nothing was to much trouble to them An very enjoyable stay ,1
 The location of the hotel is excellent and our room was quiet ,1
No Negative,0
 My only complaints are that the tv in the bedroom area was to the side and it made it hard for us both to see well The sheets seemed too small or were put on wrong and we had to rearrange them And we didn t get enough towels for the whole family We were usually in a hurry to make it to breakfast before the crowd so one child alternated shower days anyway Also extra pillows would have been nice too The kids never complained about the sofa bed ,0

 The location and comfort of this hotel was first class As you would expect for London and this area it is not the cheapest but the studio room and views were first class We used the restaurants in the hotel and the food was excellent though expensive but again for London it was fine Children are well catered for and the staff very helpful Will return again ,1

 Room was tiny marginally bigger than the bed and more importantly there was no where to put anything be it my bag or even just a hair brush The bathroom is what is euphemistically known as a wet room meaning everything gets soaked when you have a shower You therefore have to plan your morning routine carefully unless you don t mind cleaning your teeth while standing in a puddle ,0

The hotel was conveniently located between two major tube stations We were due to check for in at 2pm but they let us check in when we arrived at 11am We really only used the hotel as a base we weren t there very much so I can t comment on the facilities or breakfast But I was very satisfied with what we got for what I paid,1
 Rooms are spotless and very well appointed Every member of staff was so friendly so helpful Really enjoyed every minute ,1
 only comment was there was no milk provided on our third day in our room ,0
 Attentive service and a well managed check in We ended up being upgraded which was amazing City skyline and London Eye views were stunning Very well appointed room Helpful concierges meant never waiting for a cab breakfast was little pricy but a very pragmatic approach to feeding the kids Easy walk from waterloo which connected directly with Euston station so straight to the heart of the landmark district ,1

 Rooms facing the back were a bit noisy probably because of the external units of the air conditioning but it was manageable Rooms are rather small but this is common for London ,0
 We arrived after a long journey only to be told they were going to transfer us to one of their sister hotels in Paddington When we objected they miraculously found a room for us ,0
 The hotel was being renovated which gave it a slightly run down appearance The sink in our room was cracked and there was no hair conditioner available in the hotel The television was very small and dated ,0

 We thought the room was a bit smaller than we expected but nevertheless was very clean and comfortable and had everything we needed for our one night stay and did not include things we didn t need or use such as posh note pads and mini fridges A trouser press for the men would have been useful after all there was a hair dryer for the ladies ,0

The fact that building work meant the nightclub and half hotel were closed Woken by builders two mornings at 7am complained to reception who said it was saturday the next day so shouldnt get woken up no other compensation offered apart from a drink token on arrival in the form of two halves of heineken not good enough in our opinion,0
 Location was the best ,1
 Comfortable bed Good facilities ,1
That s the beds were not secured and if you sat up in bed to watch TV or read the bed moved forward away from wall The bathroom was a bit cramped around the toilet due to the large sink There was a smell coming from the sink when you used it I think its needs some bleach We did not eat breakfast at the hotel due to the price of 19 50 each for 2 nights would be nearly 80 00 We ate out instead,0
 nothing to dislike,0

I was completely disappointed and mad since the reception staff are generally unfriendly More specifically Brad Brad not only he talks to guests with an attitude and from an upper position he always thinks he is right Without notification to me or alignment with me he deducted the whole amount of the stay from my credit card instead of preauthorization He claimed that this is the hotel policy to deduct the whole amount if the stay is more than 7 nights I told him I was not aware of such policy and asked him to show me where it is written He said it is not written anywhere and the hotel is not supposed to show the guests all the policies I told him I disagree especially if it is related to terms and payments I asked to speak to his manager he said I am the manager Then I asked to speak to his superior Then he said I will cancel the sales and preauthoriz again the amount I told him this will not work as it will take at least 5 days to reverse the payment He said that he is sure it will take few hours Unfortunately he cancelled it and took 5 working days During this period the amount he deducted was stuck between banks and the hotel keeps trying to preauthoriz the amount and notifications from my bank keeps coming to my phone with failed attempted Of course those attempts hurt my credit records with the bank I was devastated and angry but no one said sorry and no compensation were provided to me Horrible customer experience,0

Did not like the 1st room we were given however without too much trouble we were able to change to a nicer room The restaurant leaves a lot to be desired far too many people for such a small restaurant not enough room to enjoy breakfast leisurely,0
1 All staff they re perfect 2 locations is perfect,1
 If you are looking for sightseeing this is the place to stay as everything is close to this hotel The couch became a double bed while we had a king size double bed as well When we walked in everyone was open and started complimenting me and my friends ,1

 Good comfy bed great stay,1
 Freindly staff Great decor Good location,1
 They upgraded us to the penthouse ,1
The only issue was that the duvet was too light and too small for a double bed So we had to keep the heating quite high to compensate The bathroom was small but had a bath The room was clean when we checked in but the quality of housekeeping in the subsequent days was not the best They never cleaned the spot of toothpaste that fell on the sink counter The check in process was a pain We arrived at 1 30 so 30 minutes early than the check in time so the room was not ready That was ok and we decided to wait in the hall No one ever came to tell us the room was ready and after 45 minutes I had to enquire and the person at the check in desk did not know and had to go and ask someone else When we finally got the key 5 minutes later we had to wait another 5 minutes to get our luggage which they insisted to put away instead of leaving it with us in the hall Overall the experience was ok and the price quality good for London,0
No Negative,0
 Parking was an issue and we had to spend time asking around other hotels for a space Breakfast quite comprehensive get in quick or you ll miss out on some items Breakfast tea was not a brand to savour Left it after a sip Some guests had also left items uncovered e g Cheese selection and flies were enjoying these There was a timid fox in the garden Although it was lovely to see with small children in particular it is a risk Mobile coverage seemed to be poor and Wifi alleviated issues to some extent ,0
 The room was very small bed was small and bathroom was to small to get in couldn t move in there Also hairdryer wouldn t come out of drawer so couldn t dry hair well Not good value for money False advertising Expensive for what you get ,0

 Amazingly quiet for such a great central location,1
 Nearer to a tube station but that can t be helped Hotel is great ,0
The musty smell in hallway and that the 5th floor was actually across the street in a different building,0
Housekeeping is not attentive not caring at all Once when I returned to my room at night there is not even a piece of towels in the toilet Also they won t give you enough set of towels Even if they give you they just left a pile for you to sort They never refill your toiletries needs u have to ask specifically everyday The most essential things when you finished they won t refill it for you But only replenish those you already left in full bottles but with even more that is not what you need E g I have 4 full bottles of conditioners 3 full bottles of shampoo but none for bath gel body cream They don t provide you with basic needs like slippers Cotton pads wools Q tips But we saw it in their trolley Not even refill teabags milk sugar Rooms are considered not clean to normal hotel standard,0
 Room was a club double but a little small The issue with the room was that the hotel had no hot water on the morning of our departure so I endured a cold shower and my daughter did not have one ,0
 The location to Hyde Park,1
The design of the bathroom is appaling room 654 We could not wash our hands Although some of them are smiley the front desk reception could have been more helpful,0
 Room layout was highly original and excellent Breakfast ,1
We booked jr Suit and breakfast was free Still they demanded 4 for omelet which is unacceptable,0
 Staff,0
Very close to Waterloo as travelled from Dorchester South for 2 day break,1
They must have had experience with folk not paying due to the way they went on about payment by card being automatically taken for one night Indeed payment seemed to be the focus and take priority when checking in Not a real negative but after a hard day working in London after a long commute and turning up for a really nice relaxing experience left one feeling a little oh ok that s how it is then Room was small and in the basement and you could see people walking right by on the pavement above while standing by the window when talking on the phone which I had to do since the signal was poor However it could make for an amusing gentleman s past time for someone else of course when the summer really kicks in and skirts get shorter They seem to pack rooms into that building and neighbours are easily overheard Room was rather soulless and didn t have any character or charm at all There was a small long thin vase with 2 real Carnations in which was a nice touch but it fell over and spilt the water on the floor due to the naff round metal glass table it was on being very un level as soon as I tried to move it out of the way of the pop out desk I mopped the water with a towel btw The Air Con was making a racket so I turned it off but a fan was still whirring and randomly screaming all night regardless Despite consuming several pints at the Mitre down the road in a solely medicinal attempt at ensuring slumber of any reasonable length I only got 3hrs sleep But I don t sleep very well in hotels anyway and use earplugs I was alone but the wife snores at home so is a habit so wasn t sure if the fan thing was enough of an issue to try and switch rooms During checkout I wasn t asked about my stay so didn t bother to mention it Room 114 guys beware,0

 Good service and location,1
 The hall,1
 I booked there because I was a loyal customer of Park Plaza Westmenester Bridge I like the view there and the value for money But with County Hall it enjoyed the view only,1
 The interiors are looking quite tired and the deluxe room on two levels was not to our liking This hotel was listed as four star though we would not consider this an accurate rating ,0
 Staff friendly and good location next to Waterloo station ,1
 The bed and pillows were so comfy I could have taken them home Everything was great and especially as it had not been recommended and just picked out of a few looked at on line We were just so pleased and would definitely return ,1
 View from the room was of piles of rubbish bins so we were unable to open the window during the night The bathroom had a very very small shower which was not very pleasant to use ,0
 There are two of the same franchise in the same street so watch out for that this is the one at the corner of Queens Gardens,0

 Good location right near Russell Square tube station Big room with plenty of space ,1
 Waiter on the gate is perfect,1
 the lock on room door was broken window latch broken,0
Leaky shower took 2 days to fix,0
 Incredibly small room So much so that we were a a couple with two medium size suitcases between us and it was too tight to have both on a stand each and the two of us bending over repacking without bumping into one another Can t swing a cat Or pack a suitcase,0
This is our second visit to the Park Grand it s just a 10min walk from Paddington train station The staff were welcoming and friendly the room comfortable and clean Good choice at breakfast,1

We stayed here before and found the location to be excellent for getting about central London Central line tube and bus stop only a 4 5 min walk and plenty of places to eat and drink in all directions Considering the location it is pretty quiet at night This time we opted for a club room which was pretty large and well worth the relatively small extra cost We have stayed in lots of places in London but will definitely stay here again,1
 Restaurant room service house keeping,0
 For Americans used to large They need to think smaller but no less comfortable ,1
 Everything else very poor value for money The bathroom was so small that my friend and I who both have mobility problems dare not use the bath or shower in case we could not get out again We were told that we had an upgrade to a larger room how small would the other room have been Would never go there again ,0
They offered us an upgrade which I paid for as it was my 65th birthday and I thought my wife would like it there but rather than an improvement the the room was the worst Ive had there and I have stayed a good number of times The Bathroom was in a shocking state The main air conditioning unit was right out side the window so we couldn t have the window open All in all as great disappointment,0

 Lovely clean room fantastic location which is why we book here very good for the tube clipper to reach all the attractions London has to offer Usually had a great experience but didn t match previous visits here this one was our third ,1
 Location and price,1
The room was small the elevator was quaintly small and the staff s directions were correct but not always easy to follow For example they would say turn right then go until the street ended then turn right and what you wanted was right there But they wouldn t know the names of the street or tell you that right there meant cross a major street and go 1 or 2 blocks,0
 A little cold in the room and what seemed an older heating system needed to be switched on to warm the room up not as welcoming to the room when it feels cold as you go in ,0
 rooms could do with some attention throughout especially for such a premium london based hotel should spend some money on renovating other than that it was all smiles rooms service food was bang on ,1

Asked for upgrade twin club got a double and at 11 pm had to try to split the twins and reset the room it was in the basement they offered to move us but after unpacking it was too much of a hassle they did give an apology note water and fruit in our room the next day,0
 Rooms and bathrooms larger and better air conditioning ,0

 The room was tiny which was a surprise since it is not a cheap hotel We were told we were given an upgrade I cannot imagine what we were supposed to have Also the shower screen was ridiculously skinny which defeated its purpose The bathroom mirror has a function whereby a part of it does not steam up The demisted part was too high up the mirror for me to see myself thus defeating the object once again There was very little thought put into these issues On the whole I feel we would have got more for our money at premier inn ,0
 Heat in the bathroom and shower ,0
 The bathroom was very small and had no actual shower cubicle or tray just a shower curtain and a drain It worked well enough but the addition of a shower tray would have made it much more pleasant to use ,0
 Heated floor in the shower,1
The hotel is being renovated and an extensive development is unfolding just outside During working hours the noise can be very disturbing The facilities look and sound rickety The A C is extremely loud and not very effective overall the room was too cold What s worse turning it off makes it possible to hear water flowing dropping through pipes in the walls Chinese water torture anyone The bathroom walls are transparent And I don t mean you can maybe make something out if you squint I mean Oh my word I didn t want to see that There is maybe one spot in the room where one does not have a complete view of whatever is happening inside the bathroom The staff didn t change the towels they simply re folded them 3 days in a row with no new towels The hotel is quite far from the center and there s little to do around it If you think you can walk think again and take the tram instead Or another hotel,0
 everything was great the staff are very helpful and kind breakfast was limited in choices but yummy ,1
15 min walk from Pasdington station My room was on 1 floor was a bit dark and very much noise from the outside The shower is just a hole in the floor so the floor of the bathroom is always wet,0
 Staff were disinterested and not helpful except the porters who were most excellent The room was cold and there is nothing in the room to control this Bathrobes were very well worn and tired ,0
 The location of the hotel is brilliant for all the main sights of London Rooms were spacious and clean bed comfy A taxi was booked for us no problem Decent price considering it s central London Will definitely book again,1

 Breakfast wasn t great,0
 The view from our window was over the breakfast restaurant This rendered the room windowless like a prison There was NO milk and insufficient coffee for the morning brew The mini bar was locked we clearly can t be trusted then There were so many lights one of them above the mini bar we simply couldn t find the switch for so we covered it up Breakfast was overpriced I know London is a tourist trap but a fixed cost is stupid why not charge a lower price for coffee and a croissant that is usually all most people want at that time of the morning ,0
No Negative,0
Our room was an overrated disaster room 231 dirty smelly hot and very noisy of the banging doors in the corridor and from the other rooms We moved the couch a bid and the dirt and dust of months no cleaning appeared the smell of the gutter was very disturbing the lighting was too weak and a black bathroom is the worst design disaster one can imagine We found the whole hotel dirty dusty and dated To spend more then 243 Euros for a dirty attic room is daylight robbery,0

 Loved our room it was fantastic the only thing that let it down is it was facing over a railway line and buildings so the view was a bit rubbish but that wasnt a majour issue The lady on the desk Francessca i think she was called such a lovely lady and the only staff member apart from the bar staff that genuinely made us feel welcome ,1
We asked for an invoice of the stay on departure and was told it would be emailed to us days later still nothing so I called the hotel and asked again they repeated my email to me and said it would be done right away 2 weeks later still nothing at all I think they ve over charged me for something and with them not wanting to get caught out that s why their withholding the details of my bill,0

 The building is beautiful old style with lots of carved wood and leaded glass Natural light in the bathroom which was modern and super clean No dinner available in the restaurant but there are loads of places for dinner and breakfast also if you want just a minute s walk away The hotel is on a really quiet street with a busy one around the corner Not just one but two tube stations a minute or two away ,1

No bad experience the Tempus bar needs some refurbishment especially the carpet and the fire place needs to be cheerier especially near Xmas Its a bit dull and dismal overall Ulster carpets recently refurbished the Castletroy Park Hotel in Limerick Ireland they supplied the first carpets which lasted 25 years and the new carpets which transformed the hotel Ditch that dirty burgundy carpet asap,0

The design of the room was fabulous with concealed wardrobes desk etc and was extremely comfortable The flowers fruit and bottled water were a pleasant extra and the staff couldn t have been more helpful This is the best value hotel I have ever stayed at in London and it was only a few minutes walk from Paddington and 10 minutes from Hyde Park The staff were totally professional very smart eager to help and efficient There was a comfortable lounge and a free to use smart phone and charger for maps or to book trips tours taxis etc Though we were opposite the lift on the third floor the design of the entrance hall into the room and double doors meant that no noise at hall could be heard and I had a perfect night s sleep,1

 Nothing was too much bother for the staff I was meeting up with my sister and brother in law We had tea drinks etc in the lounge Not rushed at all ,1
 I couldn t actually like anything as my partner checked in and was told we had been moved to a sister hotel down the road The entrance was more like a budget hostel the room was so tiny the bed was against the wall so we had to climb over each other to get out After a sleepless night we selected the table in the basement breakfast room with the least damp coming through the wall Absolutely disgusted at our treatment ,0
 The digging outside the Reseption But of course this will be finished ,0
 There wasn t a full length mirror in the room We were going to an event and could have done with it in addition a magnifying mirror to put on eye makeup ,0
 Room Service was disappointing,0
We had a corner room on the 11th floor with two large windows Spectacular views of Big Ben Palace of Westminster the London Eye and the city skyline over the Waterloo train station This location is awesome to go to all the Southbank attractions restaurants Waterloo train underground station Westminster Bridge and longer walks along the Thames with easy access across the many bridges into the center of the city Summer night life is so much fun as the sun didn t set until after 9 30 pm and we enjoyed a glass of wine or a pitcher of Pimm s at the Southbank Centre almost every night The room was spacious especially for a hotel in London and the bed was large and comfy This is a high rise hotel so not a boutique hotel experience but the location and value for the price can t be beat The staff were super friendly and very helpful We didn t eat at the restaurant on site so can t give a review but would highly recommend this hotel,1

Room was lovely and extremelly quiet especially after 11pm you can keep you window wide open and wont hear a sound They gave us a smartphone for free to use while we stay there was free 4g internet and free calls over the Europe and North America it helped alot to keep in touch with a family and dont get lost in Paris Staff was really nice stayed proffessional even after asking some silly questions like how the light turns on because we didnt knew that you need your room card to turn it on It is litterally 5minutes from Arc de Triopmhe which lights up wounderfully at the night and even you can pay 10 euro to get on top of it and you can see a Paris from there its absolutely beutiful Metro station is nearby which speeded up our travel instead of walking we took metro a ticket is about 2euro but it can bring you anywhere Really nice location highly recommended,1

LOCATION perfect STAFF we went into the wrong hotel initially thinking that the Park Plaza Building at the westminster bridge is the same as the county hall hotel It wasn t The staff at the Park Plaza Westminster hotel were all very warm and welcoming Their hospitality felt genuine right from the guy who greeted us at the main entrance all the way up to the lady at the reception who gave us directions going to the Park Plaza county hall hotel which was the adjacent building at the back They were all smiley and happy to assist us On the other hand the staff at the county hotel were polite and did their job alright The lady at the reception gave us a voucher for two complimentary drinks at the bar while we waited and they checked if the room was the ready It was a quick 10min wait which was fine No greeting nor smile at all from the bartender and the waiter at the Spectrum Bar It was 1500H and the bar was definitely not busy The difference between our experience between the staff from both Park Plaza Hotels was just really evident that I had to put it here ROOM SUPERIOR Room We stayed for our anniversary We got a complimentary full bottle of wine greeting card and they decorated our room with petals and swan folded towels We were also assigned to a corner room with a view of the big ben and london eye which was very beautiful at night The TV monitor in the room serves like a multimedia browser where you can view your current room bill do self check out watch youtube videos listen to the radio etc The bedroom and bath were just the right size It was not small but not too big as well We didn t have a lot of luggage with us so it was just right Mini bar was stocked with the basics We liked that there were extra pillows for us to use Bed was comfortable to sleep on but was really really squeaky and we re not big people at all if you know what i mean BREAKFAST good old continental and english breakfast,1
 The staff were really attentive and helpful with all queries Hotel quality was really good for the price and there was a good selection of food at breakfast Can t fault the hotel Also had a nice view of the Sacre Coeur from the room Although it is right by busy traffic from main roads the room was silent thanks to two sets of Windows ,1

 We loved the location of this hotel The fact that it is set in a Park away from the busy centre of dam square was great The tram system was brilliant and easy to handle The hotel is lovely and the bed was comfy Staff were very friendly and helpful and familiarized themselves with us when they realized we travelled from Ireland ,1
Booked via booking com and paid extra 10 to have the refundable option and to pay on check out However the hotel didn t inform me that before my stay they were going to take half the money out the week before my stay resulting in me nearly cancelling my card Also I had to pay on check on no issues to either but should have been informed,0
 Great hotel original concept style,1
No Positive,1
 We were very impressed with the hotel and staff We were in London for our son s university graduation and were allowed a late check out for his room so that he could come back afterwards to change clothes and rest The gesture was much appreciated ,1
We were 3 families and had 3 rooms One of the bathrooms had a clogged shower drain which resulted in the bathroom getting flooded and unable to be used The staff was unapologetic rude and refused to change the room They kept saying they would send someone to fix it but refused to understand that the family living there could not use the shower before starting their day They just shrugged their shoulders and had no solution to the immediate problem at hand which was that the guests who had paid to stay in that room had nowhere to shower They used the showers in the other two rooms we had but we lost out on our morning because of the delay The hotel is located in a popular area and is probably always busy so they really don t care The hotel needs to take their maintenance more seriously to avoid such situations They must consider training their staff to deal with such situations if and when required The only good thing was that they had fixed the shower by the time we returned at night,0
 the shower in the bathroom is not detachable and every time had to wet my hair ,0
 The feel of the hotel the friendless of the staff and the location also the in room gifts unexpected and nice ,1
 Hard to find the taxi entrance so getting the bags down the stairs is a bit tricky but the staff are happy to help ,0
Excellent location and fantastic room on the 11th floor super quiet which was great Also organised a taxi for us to the airport taxi driver Ahmed was a real star and comes highly recommended,1
 Bed was extra comfy Staff were super helpful,1
 Doesn t look a thing like the pictures ,0
 The Receptionist advised us that our room had a nice view of the park however on getting to our room you had to stand on the bed look out of the very small window to see the park ,0
 Noisy air conditioning,0
 I think the staff were a little too suggestive in having extras but this was minor we had a fruit side plate for breakfast but didn t really need this so ended up not eating it ,0
 The pull out sofa bed was a little uncomfortable as the mattress wasn t very thick Fairly understandable I suppose ,0
 the Air Con is not working well and they gave me a fan as an alternative ,0
 windows wouldn t open made the room stuffy as we cannot cope with aircon,0
 experience staff system dealing with payment and so not fair,0
 The staff was very helpful The place was clean and tidy ,1
 The hotel was further out than described and surrounded by migrant tent communities ,0

 Nice corner room with double aspect ,1
 Location Friendliness of staff Beds very comfortable Breakfast good Next to the tube station which was brilliantHotel is beautiful inside and has a commanding appearance,1
Everything was great at the hotel until breakfast which was a shambles long line of people waiting to be seated tried to push 3 of us on a very small table for 2 and did not like it when we refused to be seated until they found a table for 3 people,0
 I like the breakfast and all the staff over there Yhey are helpfull,1
 The restaurant was not big enough to cope with demand so we had to wait for a table to become free,0

 I know this is London and an extremely nice hotel but it is very expensive ,0
 Service at the restaurant for dinner was slow but it s only a small criticism ,0
 We loved the fact that our room had a balcony have stayed in many hotels in London before and never had this luxury at what was a sensible price ,1
 TV not brilliant Bed not that comfortable for me anyway I prefer a hard bed Breakfast felt like I was in an exam hall ,0
 Windows need cleaning Shower slow to drain and sink faucet leaks need fixing The only real complaint is that the doors of other rooms closing along with the fire doors at night are fairly noisy and could keep a light sleeper up ,0
Got there at 12 15 to leave bags was told Room would be ready for 1 30 when we came back to hotel at 14 00 was not ready and had to wait another 15 minutes,0
 Bedroom was the smallest I ve ever stayed in and apparently we were given a free upgrade to a Club Room God knows what the standard room size is like They accidentally booked someone else into our room and blocked our key card but apologized and gave us a free bottle of wine ,0

No Negative,0
 The location and the friendliness of the staff,1
 The only thing that mark the hotel down on was the room didn t have a window that opened Not a problem with the aircon on but I like fresh air when I sleep The bed was a little uncomfortable but no bed is ever the same as your own The shower head leaked and made the floor wet but that wasn t an inconvenience to me more of a pain for the housekeeping I guess ,0
 Location very convenient to tube nice garden area to sit in after a long day breakfast buffet was very nice,1
 Location great for the theatre,1
 The room s were small and the dark panelling made them feel a little claustrophobic for a deluxe double ,0
 I was moved to this hotel on checking into my original hotel Receptionist informed me that because of the change I was going to get breakfast inc when I went to the room I had been allocated it was very small in comparison to my original room I had booked I was disappointed and told staff who informed me that it was the only room available but I could check with her again in the morning Breakfast was ok but a very small area to move around in Think I was probably overcharged as well ,0
Asked about a room upgrade with balcony The staff offered a great upgrade for 15 Euros more It had a view of the Eiffel Tower Gorgeous,1
In my opinion there is no need to pay for breakfast The breakfast area is really small therefore leading to 20 40 min waits to eat We were lucky enough to be guided to a different serving area after waiting 15 min It was not worth the wait However I appreciate the kind gesture made by the staff,0
 The locoation was great I used to pass the building when I was studying here I felt really comfortable with a familiar environment ,1
 Really good staff excellent facilities the hotel was changed from the original booking but this was dealt with professionally by the staff ,1
 The bed was very comfy and when we arrived we got a few extras in our room as it was my boyfriends birthday ,1
 The location makes you feel unsecure There were a lot of homeless or refugees making homes in tents along the only route from the subway station to the hotel The hotel is also near to the central waste collection center which you must pass by onroute to the subway ,0
 The room we were in was small compared to other Hotels we have stayed in Also mentioned to reception as I left fingerprint marks were on the bathroom door and the door jamb maybe needed wiping down as part of the room cleaning process ,0
 The bathroom was cramped It was hard for someone adult sized to go to the toilet or use the shower easily The shower spilled water out all over the floor There was nowhere to put your dry clothes the sink area vanity splashed so it was wet and the hook behind the door was tiny and things fell off it Water from the shower would have reached it anyway as there was no door screen to the shower in that direction The breakfast was very disappointing It was lukewarm and the eggs tasted highly of vinegar We had to ask for extra teabags as the tea brought to us was very weak and not brewing well I also felt that the sausages were not entirely cooked The bacon was quite watery The selection of food was on the small side and in all it could have been cooked served better ,0
 the cheque in and breakfast was very baize,0

I booked a family room for 2 adults 2 children ages 11 12 but on arrival I was given a standard superior double room with just 1 double bed 4 people on 1 bed was extremely uncomfortable Having travelled for almost 5 hours prior to getting to the hotel around midnight I was simply top tired to complain However my family I were very disappointed,0

 Top floor rooms were so small had to leave one suitcase in the car as unable to fit it in Rooms very hot and had to have windows open in sub zero temperatures Shower over bath tub was dangerously erratic with cold water rapidly displaced by scalding water and no non slip mat or stickers in bath Lethal combination for the elderly or children Second room key not allowed by the hotel s security so had to call reception to let us in if separated Front desk staff very dismissive ,0
 Staff are too stressed may be they are under staffed Never seen so furustrated receptionist like this before We waited an exctra time to get the room which was not ready After a long journey we needed to change and kick off for a prebooked activity The delay did not help I did not expect this from such a big and pricy hotel Yet the staff were a smiley as they could be Not entirely bad ,0

 Excellent property no matter what the reason your stay in London If you wanted to be close to many of the tourist sites this is the place The life of the city This is the place And in walking distance ,1
 Door staff excellent reception staff excellent I asked for a quiet room and that was what I was given astonishing most London hotels would have ignored my request ,1
 You could hear most things in the adjacent bedrooms and because there were no net curtains or light blinds and my window was facing the internal lightwell if I opened my curtains I could see straight into the bedroom opposite ,0

 Being new in this area the conceierge service is excellent Special thanks to Mr Francis who was on duty and helped my colleague and myself several times throughout our stay ,1
 Russel Square location Very friendly competent staff Relaxed atmosphere ,1
The first night I was booked to a tiny double bedroom 033 on the ground floor and unfortunately you could hear all night cars driving and pedestrians walking by Also the room wasn t very good isolated and you could see the light from the corridor outside and the corridor door opening and shut Also the housekeeping team must have had nearby their cleaning cupboards so from 07 00am you heard loud voices and the vacuum cleaner going on The bathroom in this room was designed for a disabled wheel chair person which is ok but I felt it was a bit small and the shower was not warming up and the water pressures was low so it took ages to wash off soap etc however after i complained to the front staff about the noise and the water they put me in one of their club rooms which was better and the water pressure in the shower was good Overall I stayed in the hotel for three nights and it was a good experience,0

 Lovely hotel centrally located for travel in London Fab view from upgraded additional payment room Let down by small details as listed ,1
 Comfortable small hotel with a lived in atmosphere Staff very helpful and all facilities you need especially for a place of this size Ideally located for Southwold Would stay again ,1
 Room particularly bathroom was a bit dirty when we arrived We found a pair of women shoes under the bed a clear sign that the room was not properly cleaned In addition the daily cleaning was very basic Unacceptable for an hotel of this category Such a pity because everything else was great My advice to the management is more attention to details Having read the previous reviews it seems that the hotel managers don t really take comments on board Not conductive to maintain grow the business Listen to your customers please ,0
 The Apex Temple court Hotel is a beautiful facility that is very well located in central London You are a few minutes walk from major destinations The staff is extremely friendly very helpful and very knowldegeable Rooms are outstanding and the wifi is goodnall throughout the facility I definitely recommend the stay there for both business and leisure ,1

 The place was nicely furnished in a compact way ,1
 The room that I was given is smaller than what was shown when I reserved online and they immediately ask you to upgrade and pay more to get the bigger one The room view was to corporate offices so I couldn t open the windows no privacy inside the room because and because of that it was always lights on mode ,0

 Staff were amazing Couldn t help you enough It s a shame we were not pre warned of extensive renovation work to the hotel upon booking though Enjoy a lovely breakfast in the bar upon request the breakfast room was very busy and noisy as the main restaurant was closed for building works Rooms needing a bit of tlc as older But beds were extremely comfy bathroom was compact but very nice bath and facilities and our Club room was huge I recommend here for a short stay ,1

 That I wasn t told about the refurbishment so when we arrived i had told my girlfriend after a long tiring day it was a beautiful hotel which when we got there was covered in building works We had to walk through a temporary wood tunnel had no milk in our room for refreshments When walking around there was nobody very empty feel ,0

 The hotel is lovely and the staff were amazing They even sorted out booking a meal and taxi for me when I emailed them about this when I first booked online This was such a good idea as we found out after that it was one of the best in town It is set in a park and just looks amazing from the outside and inside is top draw too I would highly recommend ,1
 The bathroom was not only small but the shower and toilet seem to be in the same position On showering there was water flooding the whole bathroom area The bathroom tiles were poorly put together with the grating sealant coming off quite easily It was just awful I will not book this hotel ever again in this Paddington area of London ,0

 triple room is small Not enough space for big luggages You have to squeeze in to fit and not enough variety of food in the breakfast lounge,0
 Excellent breakfasts Very clean Staff was helpful ,1
The room was appalling I had originally requested a room with a balcony as a special request and I understand that may not always be possible In saying that they gave me a room in the basement Supposedly it was a bonus gift from them as it was a bigger room to what I had originally booked Which made me think how small could my room have been if this so called bigger room was this small There was a window with three magnificent view of the buildings pipe work There was a constant noise out the window from a machine of some sort There was not much room to hang clothes or put things away There was a tiny built in wardrobe which could barely fit a handful of tops but the room was for 2 I will not be staying here again,0
 The staff were all exceptionally pleasant polite helpful and attentive The hotel was sparkling clean and stylishly decorated throughout The Handy device is a great idea ,1
The staff made us feel very welcome upon our arrival and we only had to wait 10minites for our room to be ready The room was lovely and quiet facing the courtyard The facilities in the room were great and we especially liked the big shower,1
 Location,1

 Location was excellent near Hyde Park the train underground and bus routes Food was superb Atmosphere was old English just as we d hoped ,1
 There was a lot of construction in the area and the outside of the hotel is not picturesque but location makes up for this I would recommend asking for a room with a view I didn t even think about this when booking but was so happy with our room location on an upper floor The bathroom had a sliding glass door which lacked privacy this was not a big deal as I was traveling with my husband but might be weird if traveling with friends ,0
 Attitude and demeanour of the staff always so positive and helpful,1
 Everything,0
 A bath in the suite is the only thing that would have made it better The hotel was further from Paddington than we d expected,0
 Shower mechanism complex led to a minor flood ,0
 The really long and winding corridor leading to my room being a single person it was a bit spooky walking to the room late in the evening ,0
 The staff were really helpful and the hotel was in a great location ,1
Called to request early check in and was advised I needed to book an additional night night before to guarantee This was ridiculous as I only wanted to check in an hour or so earlier than the 3pm time stated I declined this and turned up at 2 40pm and was told the room wont be ready until 3 I felt this was unreasonable as I offered to pay for early check in as it was my sons birthday which is why we was staying at the hotel We wont be staying again,0
 next to a larger construction site shocking at first sight but not noisy or disturbing at least not during my stay,0
 all good,0
 There are two truths to this property s description Yes it s in London Yes it s on Hyde Park This is where it ends The Grand Royale is no hotel It is a hoStel Whether it s the mouse hole rooms lonely soaring lobby or the other fooled tourists making life miserable for the teenage staff you will regret staying here The room wasn t clean the double bed accommodates two half people and the toilet shower and sink are located together in a phone booth Spend a few quid and upgrade your stay somewhere else ,0
 Location and the staff were friendly,1
 Great restaurant bar very green area you dine literally in the park great place for morning run,1
 The hotel is incredibly handy to Earl s Court Station We loved using the garden at the rear of the hotel plus its quiet location such a bonus for enjoying a quiet G T at the end of each hectic day in London We ate breakfast daily throughout our stay in the hotel s restaurant and the freshness food quality and choices were excellent Being exhausted one night we ate dinner also in the restaurant where we chose from a limited but ample menu Must mention that we had initial fears of noise from the elevator adjacent to which our room was located There was no need to worry as we never heard a sound from it amazing We ll be using this hotel again as it suited us so well ,1

Paying 167 for 1 night for an extra city view room Which is a view of the Hotel across the road Squashed breakfast tinned food Not enough seats outside to tables Faulty equipment Room not cleaned properly not actually in county hall doors not fitted properly and no milk for a hot drink completely spoilt our 30th wedding anniversary And still no contact apology from anyone at park plaza Appalling standards for an hotel which won an award,0

The burger was a bit scary Other in our group had the chicken burger which was ok I requested a late check out the night we checked in The receptionist said to call in the morning a charge of 10pnds an hour I called in the morning at 8AM to arrange the late check out only to be told it was now not ok they need the room After that there were 5 phone calls through out the morning up until 11 30 A little funny they were desperate for this room and we had to experience 5 hang ups through out the morning not relaxing knowing they want you out as soon as possible,0
Its hard to get back to the hotel later at night since the tram is off after around midnight and walking 30mins after going out in the other end of the city can be tiring but we managed anyway This is not a big issue unless you really prefer to be in the center rather than in a beautiful quiet hotel as this one Not enough soap in the room restaurant bar snacks are very expensive Also I would ve appreciated being told that there is construction going on before the booking although this was again a non issue except for the small visual inconvenience in the entrance No noise or dirt at all,0

 I took my students to that hotel and it was great Very well located with plenty of affordable restaurants two good grocery stores and access to the subway system with two easy access to it There were lots of staff to assist you they were courteous and doing their best to accommodate our needs I will certainly go back again next time i have to stop in London ,1

 Excellent place in a great location and great room ,1
The room they gave us was on the 1st floor no 150 it was a small room looking at the interior of the hotel It was s very dark room It had only 2 windows and you could look out only through the one The only thing you could see were machinery and there was a constant noise that did not stop at all day or night The elevator did not reach our floor we had to take about 12 steps as well I do not know if this room was given to us because we booked a value deal Anyway it was not cheap Also we asked the hotel to book us a taxi for the airport They told us it will cost 55 pounds We were 2 persons and we told them that we had 5 luggage 3 big and 2 small When the taxi driver took us to the airport he charged us 65 pounds because he said we had an extra bag In my opinion this is unacceptable I would not stay in this hotel again,0

 A pleasant comfortable room Not large but perfectly nice Pleasant helpful staff ,1
The room was tiny Smaller than my bedroom at home so was disappointed considering the price we paid Definitely not what I would expect for 4 stars Would have complained but got there late after a long journey so couldn t be faced with dragging all our bags back down to reception,0
 The rooms were too dark and warm After shaving I got on a plane and realized I missed half my face The bathroom mirror was placed right on top of the toilet bowl which was absolutely disgusting Another design flaw was that you had to move the toilet seat up and down in order to flush the toilet The bedroom windows were painted shut which made it awfully stuffy hot and unbearable in the room It was difficult for bad smells to escape since there was no ventilation in the room The walkway outside the hotel room stank of chemicals and the hallway looked soulless like student dormitories One should not be paying so much money for such a low standard hotel which did not even include breakfast The staff were from anywhere else but Britain which did not help make our British experience any better ,0
 Breakfast was disappointing would of been upset if I had to pay for it,0
 The room was very small There was hardly any room to stand between the bed and the window For the price we paid I would have expected breakfast to be included ,0
 Very basic accommodation not value for money,0
 How far out it was had difficulty finding it through the roads,0
 Shower was tricky to use even with the instructions provided,0

 It s an excellent place and location is great,1
 we were on the very top floor when we got into the hotel room it was uncomfortable hot we had to phone down late at night and ask them to turn it down as we couldn t sleep had both windows wide open and the air con on The matress was uncomfortable it was rock solid we didn t get a full night sleep as we were too hot and very uncomfortable The second night in we were up watching TV and the electrics blew we had to phone down and get them to come and sort it which was very irritating afterwards the light over the shower did not work So overall not a good stay we would look elsewhere next time which is such a shame because it was such a lovely hotel and the staff were great ,0

 Two of my friends had money stolen from our safe and staff showed no interest in helping us one lady on reception actually laughed and seemed to think we were making it up Surrounding area didn t feel entirely comfortable or safe as there is a big group of homeless people Area not well lit and we struggled to figure out how to walk there from the tube station although in daylight this wasn t a problem but there is a very busy road to cross with no traffic lights in parts,0

 Being given a ridiculously small room initially and having to go back to reception and ask for a bigger one was rectified politely Building work being undertaken all round the hotel the ticket for one free drink per guest issued as compensation only covered a small drink I d rather not have the ticket for the drink than go through having that explained in the bar later that evening If you are going to compensate do it properly ,0

 Its just a nice atmosphere in the hotel and I have stayed there on many occasion,1
 No gym as its being refurbed which was not clear on the site apart from right at the bottom Also I was not allowed to then change hotel after I discovered this when i brought it up with the staff in the morning who were a little short I was then emailed far to late saying I could change but by that time I was already at work Also you changed the price of the booking the second night to add insult because of demand which apparently was on the site too Absolute joke how you can get away with that ,0
No Positive,1
We had asked for a nice room as we were celebrating our 6 month wedding anniversary but we were given a room down in basement level which obviously meant no view Then the bed consisted of two single mattresses pushed together on a wooden base which was far too big for purpose The room was smaller than we expected to get for the 436 we paid for the two nights Also the shower tray is pretty much on the same level as the bathroom floor so if you re in the shower any longer than a couple of minutes the bathroom floor gets totally flooded All in all definitely not worth the money we paid,0
 As the no disturbe ight was on at the room door they STILL called me in the middle of the morning to offer room cleaning EVERY MONDAY MORNING or so they said the hotel has a FIRE DRILL Advanced warning could have been great so guests are not scared to death when it happens and nobody answers the phone at the reception ,0
The hotel good location and clean but some staff very badly with me really I surprised from them They should be more professional and helper all coustmers they need more study and qualify in field hotel business Bcz the price increasing more that 150 that not accepted in any hotels and countries special in UK we like UK Thanks,1

 There was no hot water in the hotel so they moved us to another sister hotel down the road This hotel had tiny rooms noisy setup itchy sheets and in the middle of night a couple walked in on me as the reception gave them a key to my room Didn t sleep well Will not stay again,0
 A bit expensive for that price better properties can be rented ,0
Excellent hotel in every aspect Fantastic location with only a 2 3 minute walk to the tube station which takes you into central London Rooms are small but perfectly formed with a lovely bathroom All the staff are very polite and friendly and sorted out the small problem with the bathroom sink and brought a firmer pillow with no issues Great choice of buffet breakfast both hot and cold all replenished regularly Would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone,1

 Great Location Comfortable small rooms Descent though slightly over priced breakfast ,1
 Although I have commended the breakfast it was possibly a little over the top There really was more food than anyone could sensibly require My niece had to ask for her pillows to be changed as she has an allergy to goose and duck down Replacements were provided immediately and without question but were far too big The staff s anxiety to please is perhaps a little overpowering for people like us who are not wealthy but can manage an occasional special treat ,0
 the room was at the back of the hotel and the window was looking at another guests window poor light ng was coming through it was like a dungeon ,0

Our double bed was two twins pushed together and I kept falling into the gap Bathroom was a wet room door kept catching on the shower rail door was damaged due to the damp nowhere to put toiletries or toothbrushes loo roll almost on the floor so got damp room was dark small had no mirror furniture was a bit worn looking I prepaid for our room 5 months ago on an old bank card when we arrived at the hotel they wanted a copy of the card I paid on I no longer had this The staff member insisted that I paid again on a bank card that I had on me and that she would refund the original amount paid onto the old card I was very annoyed about this as there was no mention of having to bring the card I paid on After paying again on my only debit card it left me 150 short for my husband s birthday weekend refund will take 4 working days I had prepaid so far in advance so that I could forget about it and splash out a bit whilst in london My husband and I very rarely get a weekend without our children or the money to enjoy ourselves so this dampened the Weekend for us,0

 Bar staff were attentive and service great,1
 Loved the staff especially the concierge and Porter Once I upgraded it was a very comfy large room ,1
 The beds and pillows were very hard and uncomfortable Room had seen better days Interior needs refreshing There was what seemed like animal hair on the bed linen so unsure if the room we were given actually allowed pets Found toe nail clipping on the floor,0
 The noise An event was in in the hotel and the music was loud Not what I would expect for such a hotel The manager on duty that night was rude and un helpful The bed was uncomfortable and broken The hotel itself is beautiful such a shame the night for us was ruined by loud music and an unhelpful night manager We received a full refund for out night stay ,0

 Hangers in the room ,0
the bed was very comfortable and the linens crispy clean we paid 15pounds for the breakfast buffet which was good with fresh fruit eggs were delicious The price for breakfast is a little high I liked the free coffee in the lobby and the free apples service for breakfast excellent with lots of refills and frquent refills on the hot items which were also really hot,1
 The location is perfect Close to the tube and in the very center I have to attend Breakfast is excellent,1

 I have no idea what genius perks are Location superb ,1
 The design of the toilet bath area will get the whole floor to be wet Would be better if there is a segregation The tap of the basin seems to be old and it was very tight ,0
 The room was a good size and the location was central but quiet The staff were very friendly and welcoming and let us borrow an umbrella when the rain was really bad ,1
 Breakfast was nice really nice croissants cheese yogurts etc,1
 An excellent hotel with a great location Apart from a tap malfunction in the main bathroom everything was great A special mention to the concierge who managed to secure us tickets for the theatre at very short notice The Master suite was very roomy and very tasteful I would not hesitate to stay here when I am next again in London ,1

 more comfortable seats in bar,0
 near tube station and a supermarket good location very pleasant hotel receptionists,1
 Great decor excellent breakfast Typical English decoration historical looking inside but modernised rooms ,1
At one room service 2 Aug the service was a little slow probably because it was Sunday and I had no preserves,0
 First thing we got an upgrade from a room to a suite which was very nice Staff was helpful Real beautiful bar with terrific looking bar menu cocktails A lot of attractions of London in walking distance ,1
Pretty much everything the Dulux room isn t very Dulux at all I could hardly walk around the bed that room is that small there no storage space for your bags etc they have one cupboard wide enough to fit a couple shirts it s about 5inch deep There s was stains all over the curtains and carpet The bathroom is a tiny wet room where you have no space to actually move around,0
 the elevator was slow,0
The receptionist was very friendly I arrived about 10pm to check in and he was most helpful upbeat smiley and made me feel welcome He actually gave me a free upgrade which was very nice of him I was only there on business and would be checking out 8 hours later at 6am and the upgrade was an added perk,1
 Bed was very comfy room facilities very good,1
 Just a one night stay to see a musical at the Aldwych Theatre The hotel is ideally situated for Theatres numerous london attractions underground stations and the Thames The staff were superb we will go again ,1
 Nothing,0
 Room was on the small side but we didn t seem to notice much as we were in and out a lot and the rest of the hotel made up for it ,0
1 The hair dryer can not be used in the bathroom and that I can understand But then the plug in the room should be closer to the Mirror or at least to have a larger hair dryer electric cord Because I could not see myself in the Mirror whilst I was drying my hair So basically the hotel has have 3 options Larger hair dryer electric cord Electric plug closer to the mirror Mirror on both sides of the TV 2 Another small comment the shower mat had dessapeared the second night I guess by mistake it was removed and not replaced,0
 We had to queue for breakfast It was worth the wait but not what we expected ,0
 The ventilation pipe was passing through my room and at certain moments at night it was producing much noise not letting me sleep well The room was really small and the shower tight ,0
 Customer relations was great To the girls at the front desk all the guys of concierge the room service crew the massage therapist at the spa and last but not least the incredible Kim She was kind happy spirit and always had a smile on her face Her compassion towards people was superb Thumbs up to a great hotel ,1
 Curtains had holes in it Door of the mini bar was broken ,0
 The stunning architecture and the politeness of the staff ,1
 There was nothing i didnt like about the hotel But maybe instead of red wine maybe a bottle of schloer or some other sparkling grape juice But i didnt mind becaus ei know i didnt put that in my notes so staff would not of known but again no complaints i was just as happy with that thought ,0

 I couldn t point out anything,0
 Brilliant location between west end and Thames riverside always extra special with a warm reception and courteous staff whether front desk or room service cleaners etc,1
 On arrival at Paddington Hotel we were told that there was no hot water and that we were being transferred to another sister hotel The Hotel was the same and was a nice hotel however as we had chosen the hotel due to its close location for all our planned activities being transferred to earls court south kensington was very inconvienient and distrupted our plans to the point that we were unable to make several visits that we had planned as we were unable to walk to the locations we had booked and had to spend extra monies and time using the tube taxis We received a voice mail from the hotel in the morning advising us of this fact but as we had already left for London we did not receive it ,0
 Fantastic property Great location The rooms are clean and comfortable The staff is extremely helpful especially Julian who was nice enough to upgrade my room I would definitely recommend this property to any business or leisure travellers ,1
Apparently the hotel guests before us had replaced 2 of the minibar drinks with their own and as a result we were charged for the 2 drinks Not many cafes and food option nearby,0

 Location was great close to Arc de Triomphe Very comfortable bed Very attentive staff Faux suede walls,1
Very poor front desk service the morning we left We did not receive the wake up call we ordered and were very late leaving for the airport I attempted to get help from front desk staff who were very uninformed about transportation options to Heathrow a very basic piece of knowledge for hotel staff in London We ended up with a taxi that took 1 5 hours due to a bike race nobody at the hotel seemed aware of this either and cost about 125 If you re not from London be aware that this hotel is in more of a business district Many of the surrounding restaurants and shops were closed on Saturday We walked to Covent Garden for pretty much everything,0
 Food was very nice Busy in the mornings suggest you rise early to avoid the queue ,1
 The rooms are compact which is not unusual for London They were however well kept clean and modern with everything you need It s perfectly placed for exploring London s tourist attractions ,1
No Negative,0
 when we first arrived we were asked of we wanted to pay on arrival or when we left we said when we left and were asked to leave a guarantee of a credit card which we dont have So we had a little trouble but paid for our first night in cash and paid the following morning for the next night ,0
Room on small side for a King very expensive for the Wednesday Thursday nights First night pillows like rocks requested change and got one soft and one slab Third night managed to find 2 soft pillows Bed comfortable Not enough hangers in cupboards for 2 people staying more than 1 night Room temperature control did not go lower than 19C and seemed to revert to 25C once room key taken out Bar prices on the high side,0

 Even though our room was at the basement the room was open and spacious enough for two people It wasn t an incovenience at all We were given complimentary drinks for the room key incident ,1
 Over priced it is a nice hotel but facilities and offering is not validating price charged This time I was lucky and get very good offer on the price via booking com I will be coming back every time when I m able to secure such price Breakfast is disappointing ,0
I ordered a bottle of Prosecco for my arrival we were delayed a check in by 15 minutes whilst this was organised then when I got to my room there was no bottle I had to call reception and wait 10 more minutes The pictures online make the rooms look MUCH bigger than they are to the point of being unbelievable,0

 The location was wonderful Near public transportation as well as within walking distance to several important tourist sites The public spaces inside the building registration lobby etc were absolutely fabulous just as beautiful as the pictures on their website That s why I picked this hotel In my price range ALL the hotel rooms in London were extremely small but the Grand Royale London Hyde Park had the gorgeous common areas that set it apart from the rest The rooms were clean the staff very nice and the breakfast was delicious ,1
 Parking But not essential ,0
Breakfast is very expensive 21 12 5 even if compared to hotels like the Househorse Guards where it costs some 18 for a richer variety of products a more comfortable restaurant and a more personnal service It s better to go to Balthazar or even a Starbucks where you feel you re paying for what you get,0
 The second room for our family was not as close as we would have liked despite requesting rooms together Staff were perfunctory and showed no interest whatsoever in us or in enhancing our stay in London When asked to call a taxi they arranged an Uber car and the driver did not know how to get to the destination a tube station so my husband had to use his own phone to navigate Expensive for what we got ,0
 That their system couldn t heat the room and I had to use a heater ,0
 The television and beside control didn t seem to work although that could have been me ,0

There were construction works at the front of the hotel but this didn t make much impact when inside However in the reception and all the way to the bottom floor lift was a strong eggy smell that I can only put down to the work outside It was abit gross but once we were by the actual rooms any sign of abnormal smell or noise were gone completely Considering it was a 4 star the room could have been abit neater ie The corners of the room were abit dusty the paint on the windows was cracking but there was nothing major,0
 The staff were fantastic We requested an ice bucket and it was at the room almost straight away The gentleman who checked us in remembered my name Our bathroom had the most amazing bath and overall we felt we got upgraded ,1
 I think that the Location of this hotel is so good,1
 great value for money,1
 Staff was excellent ,1
 upgraded when we arrived to a lovely spacious room overlooking the square Reception staff were plentiful and well informed ,1
 Quiet room as requested Easy check in and check out Friendly staff Great location ,1
 The expense of the food,0
My room was given to other guests when they checked in I was out but my clothes etc where clear to be seen When I spoke to the reception the response was I am night staff so I don t know anything This was a surprisingly unhelpful and unsatisfactory response I also had to phone 4 times for someone to open my safe before the v pleasant gentleman arrived,0
 Hotel is lovely very clean and everything you need hairdryer supplied and no need to bring my owe as if very long hair some hotel hairdryers are shocking Central to the tubes and busses and staff very helpful when look for directions ,1
Their idea of separate beds was two mattresses 3 cm apart from each other with no possibility to move them The feedback form in the room was for some other hotel chain,0
 Unexpected complimentary room upgrade upon arrival ,1
 It took a while in the lifts to get to and from room bar area was a little small considering hotel was child friendly Childs menu was not much choice the breakfast was very poor coffee tasted like the cheapest coffee you could buy not much room in breakfast restaurant or in the bar definitely not worth the money we paid,0
I arrived early in the morning after a long trip from Africa I was able to take a shower and change clothes in the wellness centre which made the day fo me Perfect for 2 nights in transit between a long journey from Africa and a really long journey to NZ Quiet yet less than 5 minute walk to Piccadilly line at Earl s Court even dragging heavy suitcase,1
 Room was a bit tired the air unit or heater or whatever buzzed all night which was very annoying and storage closet space was limited London itself has become a tarpit foul air congestion and everything and I mean everything is so grossly overpriced The city probably tainted my view on the hotel somewhat but I will never visit London again other than perhaps in transit to somewhere more pleasant ,0

Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights with my boyfriend The hotel was perfect A short distance to the square with the tram located near the hotel Perfect loctation lovely park beside the hotel with cafes nearby Staff were very helpful and the hotel in general is fabulous very modern and the bedroom was just great the layout was fantastic with cute steps up to the bed which was super comfy We really enjoyed our stay,1
 Lack of swimming pool ,0
 The bed was extremely comfortable,1
 View from room overlooked old dull buildings ,0
 EVERYTHING friendly helpful staff lovely clean rooms food delicious ,1
The rooms were big and beautiful nothing to complain about the only problem we had was we had booked adjoining rooms and when we went to the hotel they said they don t have adjoining rooms it was the fault of bookings com to mention that it was adjoining rooms and not the hotels fault so with the kids we had to use 2 rooms which was inconvenient really to be in completely separate rooms and the location is not that great and a little scary to travel after dark the staff not that friendly or helpful either,1
 See above tangent ,0

Could have been more than 2 Nespresso pods if you are a couple it would be great to maybe have 2 decaf 4 regular pods but then again not many hotels have a Nespresso machine in the room to begin with,0

 The room was of excellent quality and the bed was so comfortable I could stay there again for this reason alone WiFi being free and of good quality was important for someone like myself roaming with my mobile network Staff were extremely friendly and professional I would recommend this hotel to everyone possible ,1
There is no shower cabinet but the shower is only separated via curtain The complete bathroom was wet after taking 10 minutes shower At check in they offered to give us a local smart phone and we signed some papers It was supposed to be at room but we never received the phone even after calling the reception from the room twice When we asked at reception they apologized for it and told us there was a problem but I found it quite weird,0
 i just enjoyed my stay ,1
 The shower was interesting as it was in the corner of bathroom with only the curtain separating it Needless to say the entire floor and a couple of walls and maybe the roll of tp were soaked following use ,0
After hauling 4 suitcases across London we were informed there was a boiler problem and we had to be moved After my initial reservations the sister hotel just around the corner exceeded our expectations The staff are truly amazing and went out of their way to ensure a great stay,0
Fire alarm was working 2 times The first one was at 11 am and the second was at 11pm And they said it was test while they asked of evacuated and all the gust went to the evacuation point,0

 Location,1
 The hotel is in an excellent location the reception staff were very efficient and the hotel had a certain amount of old world glamour about it ,1
The fact that the shower flooded the bathroom due to the floor being all one level nice idea in principle but in practice it doesn t work well We had to use some of the towels to dry the floor Also a member of the cleaning staff knocked on our door at about 0830 to see if they could get in to clean the room Checkout wasn t until midday and if we had checked out early then this could have been relayed from reception as to what rooms were ready to clean Disturbed a very rare lie in for my wife and I View from the room was to the inner atrium so all you could see were more rooms This was a shame as being on the 13th floor it would have been nice to have an external window,0
 Bed was very comfortable and air conditioning and shower worked great,1
 Small bed more expensive than pricing provided by booking com noisy AC impossible to sleep bedroom with no windows in the cellar,0
 Couldn t turn off tap in wash basin Handle on shower control came off ,0
Seemed slightly shambolic I checked in around 7pm and yet I was told I wouldn t have towels until an hour later although when I actually went to the room the towels were there but the bathroom just seemed a little ehhh I kept finding stray hairs around the place that didn t belong to me Bit gross,0

I had a sleepless night at this hotel the room 807 must have the air conditioning system outside it There was a hum of noise from this system all night the equivalent of an idling car which was impossible to sleep through I won t be staying again,0

On arrival we were Met with a long que to reception when we did get served we were told they didn t have a room available for us due to maintenance work They said to go to the bar for a complementary drink and they would have a taxi pick us up and take us in 10 mins An hour and half later we were still waiting I asked them to get me a room in there hotel as other people were checking in They agreed and we ended up in a basement room which was very small Tv didn t have a remote to operate it either It definatley was not a four star room or experience We had to que 30 mins to get into the breakfast room When we did get in they had no cerial bowls so we had to use dinner plates to eat fruit and yogurt They clearly were struggling to cope as the beans sausage bacon etc was all depleted at different times Worst hotel experience for us for a long time Shame as we were there for my wife s birthday,0
Being woken at 5am by a wake up call I did not order Being woken ten minutes later by a phone call Then the teenagers next door slammed the door numerous times from 6am to 6 45am until I asked them to stop The manager on duty was not helpful and advised that I was not the only one woken up by the automated wake up call system He advised that at least 15 other guests were also called that did not make me feel better and there was no effort to mitigate my dissatisfaction,0

 I was expecting a delivery at the reception and despite having a confirmation of the delivery the night staff refused to give it to me arguing that it has never been delivered It is only when I ve threatened them to call the police that my package suddenly reappeared without the slightest apology Outrageous I strongly advise you to chose another hotel if you have any concern for your belongings ,0

I booked a double room but it turned out to be 2 single beds pushed together We found it very uncomfortable Also the beds had seperate single bed sheets on them so no effort was made to even make it appear like a double bed double sheets at least would have been a start Breakfast instead of new unpealed potatoes chips would be better The sausages were undercooked and the beans were cheap I WAS REALLY DISSAPOINTED when we returned back from breakfast we noticed that someone had came into our room and stolen a mars bar that was on the bedside cabinet It made it worse by the fact it was a double mars bar so someone had torn it open and taken half then just left the other half in the torn wrapper and left it on the table I reported this incident to the duty manager she said she would look into it I really do not expect this kind of thing to happen especially in a reputable place like this It s not the item itself that i m concerned about but it s rather the value of principle,0

 The location is unbeatable The staff are friendly and very helpful Max of the concierge staff was very helpful friendly and enthusiastic ,1
 Small room very small bathroom High level Windows meant no outlook ,0
 We were given a complementary upgrade on arrival which was very much appreciated ,1
 We enjoyed our dinner in the Hotel Restaurant The location is very handy for Westminster Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament the Southbank of the River Thames with its many restaurants cafes and Waterloo Station for connections to London Underground and national rail services ,1
 Went to Marriott County Hall by mistake having known County Hall before it became a hotel Park Plaza County Hall is not at the old County Hall although it is nearby I think it confusing to have a Marriott County Hall and a Park Plaza County Hall close together although a traveller without prior knowledge would probably read the website more carefully than I did ,0
 We got a room that was very small and not very fresh The pictures on the hotels website for std dbl room was not what we got We could change room though ,0
No Negative,0
The minuses were athough they did not influence me to give a goog review is that the restaurant may not be so expensive but we had room service once had a basic pizza and it was horrible and it costed 35 The second situation was in the hotel bar when the waiter took our order we waited 20 minutes for a drink and again waited after he renturned for the second time,0
 Rooms very good,1
Internet speed of 1MB apparently I didn t test it as my data plan runs faster But there was no milk supplied for my tea a true travesty,0

 Amazing location We didn t pay extra to face the London Eye but were given a room on that side of the hotel The gym had everything we needed too ,1
Did book a twin bedded room and got a very large double so it didn t matter too much Loo very low lucky I am only 5ft 2,0
 The hotel is very clean The double bed was very small It is a bad and a half in a double luxury room Room had micro fridge and tea coffe but it is a very small room,1
We spend 5 nights in three different rooms We were moved twice due to very very poor Quality rooms This is a lovely looking hotel from the street with marvellous staff and a great position but a hotel that is well over due for a complete makeover I would suggest for the price to stay at the Russell you could do MUCH better elsewhere,0

 Location is excellent,1
 Great value for money good location in london access to a nice garden,1
 All good,0
I just don t think a room without breakfast is worth 269 I suppose the problem is that if people will pay it you can charge it,0
 We were able to be moved immediately after asking after our shower broke and maintence had to be called However due to the inconvenience we were moved to the executive suite which was amazing Staff were so kind I would definitely stay there again D staff also left a lovely surprise for my other half a birthday which was so kind ,1

The room was very nice but not much space around beds to move around with four in the room We had a fantastic view of the the London eye but not much of the city from the 6th floor The staff were very friendly and helpful A great hotel that treated children warmly as guests It was very crowded in the breakfast area and they opened up the bar area to serve as many guests as they could The mini bar area with extra sink was very nice as was the very clean bathroom with a defogging mirror,1

The staff is unfriendly and unhelpful Not all of them but Mark was so tough and unhelpful Another lady caused me the problem of having another room reserved and paid without chick in She supposed to contact the reservation for me since morning and she did not do anything in more than 12 hours The guest manager did not help me as well and never apologise for inconvinience I was not waiting to refund my money but at least to give me my right to use the room anf to apologise Come on they know nothing about communicating with customer Their English is poor A man in the comcierge treated me like a He shouted in my face resusing to bring my luggage bcause he is too busy right now while I have not asked him to bring them immedietely I had then to bring them by my seld the blond gentelman in concierge was so friendly and polite and apologised to me for what his colleage did Finally I would never go back to that hotel I paid more than 300 per night and staid for 5 nights The value for my money was zero,0
 The breads at breakfast were not as fresh as I thought they should be Having said that the range of choice was excellent,0
 It s a tired old building We had problems with plumbing A C didn t work elevator is so tiny two people plus luggage fill it up Windows didn t open There is no business center to print airline tickets Overall it was expensive and there are other choices nearby at the same or lower cost ,0
location is great close to 2 tube stations lobby public areas lovely old world feel but rooms spacious very clean all requests followed up quickly with smiles beds very comfortable with a choice of pillows,1
This hotel was perfect for us We could walk to many sites and museums and the tube stop was right around the corner if we didn t walk It s a 10 minute walk to Euston Station or King s Cross The hotel is very elegant with a beautiful lobby Our room was really comfortable and quiet The bathroom was good sized We had a mini fridge and a tea kettle so we could have tea in our room the wifi was good Really everything we needed to be comfortable was provided and we were in a great location We loved it and would definitely stay here next time we re in London,1
 Great location Close to two tube stations Tasty and fresh breakfast Good service Only the bathroom and shower was too small to feel super comfortable Other than that Perfect Hotel for a stay in London,1

For the price paid 1 2 normal rate I thought this was a good value hotel Plate of fruit was a nice touch as were the pack of jammy dodgers with the tea and coffee making facilities The room was smallish but well laid out I stayed for one night The location is great and if you re visiting London for the first time this hotel is easily accessible from the train station and tube at Paddington,1
 Excellent pillows,1
 Overall the stay at Park Plaza County Hall met my expectations The only inconvenience was the lifts It felt like you were waiting quite a while for lifts to call at your floor ,0
The first room I was given was 801 which is right at the top of the building in what feels like the attic and the water heater in was bubbling all night and I could not sleep,0
 Breakfast is excellent Good choice and offer porridge which is always a bonus Staff recognised that we had stayed before and welcomed us back Waiting staff at breakfast were very attentive Bath towels were beautifully white and fluffy bed comfy and the room was spotless The room had a beautiful view of the gardens This is why we came back ,1
 super staff Very flexible Loved the location it was perfect ,1
 Good amenities in the room ,1
 We booked a twin room only to arrive and find out that there were no twin rooms available At the end the receptionist could find a room in a sister Hotel nearby which apparently was bigger than the one we booked Thus they wanted us to move again the next day which we refused since we had unpacked everything We booked a Club room with club Lounge Access from booking com However we found out that the Club Lounge was open to the guest only upon availibility At least one of the days the Lounge was busy all day and not on use for the guests ,0
 Excellent location and comfortable accomodations Good value for the money ,1
 Bed was wonderful breakfast eggs were a watery disaster the shower in the deluxe double was a drain in the floor shared with the loo the bathroom tile grout needed serious scrubbing gross and when I needed change for a smaller money denomination was told that was not possible by a blonde trainee But very quiet room with great view and close to Paddington and Harrods also the rest of the in house staff went the extra mile,1
The air conditioner seems not to work because although I adjust it to 32 degrees but actually I felt less than 20 degrees and it was cold during night Also I booked for a double bed but initially it was 2 single beds next to each other Once I asked for a double bed they just put something like mattress protector to cover the gap between the 2 single mattresses,0

I was setting in the Reception Reception staff they are not respecting the customer they are saying to some customer at 2 clock you can get the key and other giving them the key When I spoke to her she said we have categories I told her I know you have categories when first customer came I kept quite because they are 2 but when you allow for other single customer to get the key that mean there is no management and no respect for customer and that not fair she didn t give me any answer just said wait 15 min it will reach 2 and you will get the key after 5 min asking me to get the they how she arranged they faster The reception is the front of the hotel if the employee s behavior is abusive the owner will be looses My evidence hotel camera,0

 The style of hotel,1
 Very reasonable rate spotlessly clean standard room Very good breakfast with smiling helpful and polite staff Nice bar area ,1
 Room was tiny and was literally next to a lift built behind the cupboards You can hear it clearly every time someone uses it Definitely ask for a room away from one There is a very annoying and fairly loud noise that randomly kicks in any time of the day Guess its the air conditioning but frustrating when you already have the lift making noises from your cupboard The pillows are far too soft your head sinks in and its not comfortable ,0
 Excellent location friendly staff reletively rich breakfast ,1
 The brunch to purchase in the morning was good ,1

 lovely hotel great to look out on to hyde park and walk through to the centre of London staff are polite but don t have authority to rectify things just explain politely that is policy,1
 Friendly staff nice rooms comfy bed though pillows aren t as comfy as they look There are two trams that leave from close to the hotel and one goes directly to Central and both go to the main tourist hub Oosterpark right on your door step,1
 Friendly helpful staff Comfortable bed Good breakfast ,1
 Excellent location within walking distance to all major attractions in London The service of all the Front Desk and Concierge staff that I came across with are all enthusiastic good The room size is good considering it situates at such an excellent location ,1
We stayed here the first time and had a great experience great room the room service order got screwed up but we weren t to bothered Awesome location We liked it so much we came back a few days later and it was terrible I think we must have been upgraded to a nicer room the first time without being told so the second time when they offered us an upgraded room we declined thinking it would be the same as before It sure wasn t The room stunk had a bank of about 20 aircon units outside the window the air con in the room didn t work so we had to have the windows open in the middle of winter to keen it cool The bathroom was filthy and the bed extremely uncomfortable and squeaky Would never stay in this rooms again but the upgraded rooms are really good They also screwed up our room service order the second time and the operator didn t know what a hashbrown was even though it was on the menu,1
We dropped our luggage off early which we were told is not a problem but when we checked in later we were told that our luggage had been taken to our room but had not It then took 3 calls to reception and a wait of 3 4hr for it to arrive making us late for our evening meal,0
 Warmth of room too hot ,0
 The bed was comfy and the breakfast was good ,1
 breakfast staff in the hall check in out ,0
Room was quite cold only air conditioning was available and not needed considering its winter Buffet breakfast was nice but area is too small considering the number of people we saw each morning Luckily with a 6 year old we were early for breakfast only saw queues on leaving Tables very cramped and area cold with lobby doors constantly being opened Small things i noticed were no facecloths in bathroom or cleaning liquid cloth for kitchenette,0
 the staffs are friendly helpful we got our room upgrade to club clean,1
 The staff made us feel welcome and valued immediately Were given upgrade and complementary breakfasts due to maintenance work Room was immaculate and very comfortable Very close to underground and Hyde Park Would stay here again ,1
 Nothing bad it was as described and can t fault our stay,0
 The room was a little stuffy They didn t have AC on yet Probably too early in the season Shower sometimes went hot and then cold ,0
 Staff were very attentive and friendly ,1
 A great location Perfect for access to Paddington and the Heathrow Express as well as an easy walk to the West End shops The room was small and wardrobe space very limited It was however perfect for a short stay and it was clean The staff were also friendly and helpful ,1
 Extensive restorations works going on We had scaffolding outside our window blocking the view Temporary reception area The building is an old hospital you can still see the hospital aspects on the inside When the work is completed i m sure it will be fabulous No fridge in the room well there was one but it was very ineffective ,0

 Being ripped off because of the conference that was being held there Not paid for by corporate but charged same inflated price isn t fair in ordinary holiday or leisure customers,0
VERY over priced Stated as a four star and in my opinion not even close Room floor squeaked every where was annoying unless you made it a game to try and walk from bed to bath without squeaking not possible Room given was NOT the room pictured in the ad when I reserved as junior suite not even close although I was told on site it was one of the best buyer beware Shower bath access was difficult and I am very agile The tub rim to step over was to my knee caps and I am 6 3 so if you are short good luck,0
We booked a superior then upgraded to a junior suite we found a mouse in the room and it was handled terribly They moved us to a smaller room with a bad view and it was 2 single beds pushed together They gave us the 60 it cost to upgrade back and offered us complimentary breakfast but after seeing a mouse in our room there was no way we were going to eat there They then offered champagne which when it came to the room was not champagne at all it was sparkling wine For the amount we paid to find a mouse in the room and for the staff to not even care it s fair to say we will never be staying there again,0
 Staff were excellent,1

 The fact that I wanted to extend the stay which they were unable to do where as when I rang them before leaving I was told I could So then I had no choice but to pay extra I felt the staff was useless ,0

 Looks like rooms are not cleaned properly We stayed for four nights On the first evening my son unpacked a book and threw packaging under the bed which I noticed later The teared packaging has not been picked up until we were leaving and I saw it and threw away Not a great evidence of cleaning service ,0
 They had a xmas party and put us in a room above however they did acknowledge the problem to our satisfaction,0
 Both of the taps were warm so I couldn t get any cold water The dish towel was not very good and did not dry the dishes well,0
 Absolutely nothing ,0
We arrived at 8 30am and the staff offered us an option for a room right away which was reasonable and allowed us to clean up before hitting the sights in London Great Although the view was far from good it didn t matter to us since we were leaving however NOT sure they should have charged us extra given the view I think if you are going to charge an extra 30 pounds for early access then for the money something should be provided like a view But we greatly appreciated having a room to store our stuff and clean up after such a long flight from US,1

We had arranged to have a continental breakfast my husband changed his mind When checking out the manager charged us the difference for 3 people having a full English breakfast When challenged and asked for a receipt the manager rudely passed threw the receipt to my husband My husband asked he why he did it and was ignored A sad ending to an otherwise very enjoyable stay,0

 That fact I booked a penthouse suite for New Year s Eve on the basis we had a view of the London eye based on the images used booking com On arrival we were advised that our room was south facing meaning we had no view of the fireworks what so ever,0
 Fantastic hotel near the Sorbonne on the Paris left bank Close to many restaurants and bars but outside the tourist zone Our room was a decent size and very comfortable The hotel has character but has been refurbished and tastefully decorated Our room faced the street but at night it was quiet There are always refreshments in reception and very friendly staff ,1

My boyfriend and I wanted to spend a special Christmas in London and decided to splurge on what was advertised in pictures a lavish London hotel The room we received was nothing like the pictures advertised It was very small and very plain the decor was very outdated and looked like it was from the 70 s or something The breakfast was 15 pounds per person which is ridiculous The staff messed up my room payment which made the check in a nightmare The bar staff did not know how to properly make drinks Overall I was thoroughly disappointed with the hotel Our room looked straight out of a Motel 5 and was so small we could barely move around not exaggerating we could barely move This was not a supposedly a 4 star grand royale hotel I will never go back here and do not recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a lush place to stay in London For the amount we paid we expected a lot more Its not as advertised,0
 Poor control on heating,0
The breakfast was too expensive and 25 euros meant that I never got to try the breakfast,0
 My room had the old style windows and so the draft and noise from the main road was slightly inconvenient but did not detract from my experience ,0

 great location for British Museum lovely building,1
 Hotel Management promptly reached out to me after reaching out to them to voice my concerns with my Park Plaza experience They were apologetic and quickly spoke to the departments that I had experienced sub par hotel service to try and address any issues Hotel Management also was very generous in their offer for compensation to compensate for my poor experience even though I declined any compensation I was very pleased with their desire to correct my issues to be consistent with standard Park Plaza experiences After speaking with Hotel Management I feel more comfortable with the possibility of returning to Park Plaza ,1

Hotel is under repair our room was in the lower ground floor with no natural light and was noisy The 2 nd room booked for our friends was rather small but being on 7th floor they could see out of the window,0
 The bed was very comfortable The mobile device for tourists was handy and a nice touch Staff were very polite and welcoming ,1
 Great hotel centrally situated alongside the Thames and BigBen Staff are very friendly and helpful will definately book at this hotel again,1
 Only stay here if a loud fan in the room does not bother you Even when I switched it off it was still really noisy The result minimal sleep Not ideal when all you want is a peaceful nights sleep ahead of a busy day ,0
The room is like what they have in Italy I mean the single room is really small The overall cleanliess is OK I wasn t happy with the dust on the towel rack or the desk tho And the fact that a 4 star hotel doesn t have a fridge nor a scale in the bathroom was really annoying,0
 Everything ,1
No Negative,0
 Room very small but only stayed one night not a big problem,0
 Room was smaller than anticipated room layout not ideal,0
 The room was tight chairs too bulky for little room ,0
 This is my favorite hotel in the world and it still is I wrote the manager a good letter especially about his great staff but for some reason it could not be delivered Please tell him because I name names and want them rewarded ,1
We waited 35 minutes to start the checking in process while the two out of their depth receptionists struggled with a handful of guests Despite the fact that we arrived late in the afternoon owing to a broken down train our room wasn t ready The guests lounge seemed to be permanently closed The employment of a concierge would have improved matters greatly,0

I did ask for a slightly earlier check in 12 instead of standard 2pm as I had just travelled from Australia they had not received this request I only had to wait for one hour instead of two this was greatly appreciated Lovely bathroom for a small room,1
 The room we were in only had a view of rooms across the other side of the building ,0
Ridiculously overpriced Couldn t cont them on phone number on their website or booking com booking page Staff unfriendly and unhelpful Included breakfast was basic boring and cold Bathroom temperature always set to very high temperature Laundry facilities inadequate we re traveling g for 2 months There for a week and housekeeping room maintenance worse each day Bed not made properly Dirty cups and room service tray left in room plus rubbish Would not recommend this hotel to anyone Email I sent still unanswered,0
 The first night we were given an extremely small room with the bathroom door broken Next morning when we made a complaint they gave us a perfect room ,0
 The rooms while clean are small,0
The hotel more than met our requirements for our 1 night stay We had booked a deluxe triple deluxe double room for our family of 5 As it states in the blurb the rooms are described as compact and our double was just that but we did not find this an issue and found the room to be comfortable modern and clean The bathroom looked new with modern fittings a lovely shower with an adjustable wall mounted head rainfall overhead fitting We also had ample tea coffee supplies bottled water biscuits and a selection of fresh fruit The reception and public rooms have been tastefully restored and give the hotel real character All the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful Finally the location is a real bonus as there are 2 tube stops within 2 minutes walk Hyde Park is just across the road and there are numerous bus stops However if you don t mind a walk then the West End is about 25 minutes way on foot We also had a lovely surprise when we checked in as instead of the triple room we had booked we had been upgraded to the Lily Langtry suite which made our stay that extra bit special,1

We found this hotel literally at the last minute having arrived in London in the early evening to find that the original guest house that we had booked 7 months earlier had given away our room to someone else and the room we were being given would not have twin beds Upgrading to a Club room provided us with a lounge area on the 5th floor which was very nice as the rooms are small The beds were comfortable and the room was very clean The location is excellent the hotel is within a 5 minute walk to two tube stations numerous restaurants and grocery stores The staff was very friendly and helpful,1

The rooms were to small and everything crammed in The overall condition of hotel is poor with major decoration work needed Bathroom was in poor condition with bath panels falling off the extractor fan did not work There was excessive noise from outside I e The kitchen vents etc so we could not have windows open at night if we had wanted to open them it was only about 5 which is ridiculous The air conditioning was so loud we could not get a full nights sleep it also seemed to be stuck at one temp even if you adjusted it The TV remote did not work properly so had to use controls on the TV unit itself which meant getting out of bed to turn TV off which at the hotel prices should never be the case we wanted luxury not excercise,0

 very bad location in a really insecure and unsafe neighborhood NEVER even try to book there there were people using DRUGS just outside the hotel we tried to cancel our booking when we saw the hotel but they d dn t let us The staff was not helpful and grumpy On top of this the TV was broken and there were peanuts behind it they probably d dn t clean t properly also there was a constant smell n the elevators Later on we moved to a different place we were told that the hotel was located in the sketch est neighborhood of Paris right next to the dumping ground A BIG NO if you want to stay SAFE ,0

 I was actually moved to the Paddington Court location a block away from the London Paddington still Park Grand chain I appreciated a modern comfortable well designed room that met all my needs even though it was tiny that s just London Short walk to either Paddington or Lancaster Gate stations in a very nice neighbourhood away from the tacky side of Paddington I would definitely return here in the future ,1
 Room clean modern and made decent use of small space,1
 I booked this for my parents for their Golden Wedding Anniversary trip to London with another couple all four said how fantastic their stay was They commented in particular about how friendly and helpful the staff were and HOW impressed they were with their room and the hotel facilities ,1

 even though there was a minor inconvenience on our arrival the staff went above and beyond in trying to accommodate us Compliments to all staff they were courteous always willing to help with a smile on their faces And Alston at the front desk deserves a thumbs up for his professional treatment and kindness I will recommend this hotel to family and friends I felt like I was in old London which was very special Thanks to all the staff ,1

I would say the best hotel we have stayed in And we travel a lot I like watching hotel impossible and this hotel passed all the tests with flying colors Super clean I felt right at home This was the first hotel i went in the shower with bare feet The staff is simply 5 stars from housekeeping room service and of course the front desk staff Just amazing thank you all Best location too We shall return,1
I understand that room rates are high in this part of London and that One Aldwych is a very high standard hotel with 24hr room service but I felt that it wouldn t be too much to ask for tea and coffee making facilities in the room and that breakfast items were very expensive even compared to the restaurant dinner prices However the pub across the road serves an excellent breakfast at less eye watering prices,0
Check in was frustrating our room had been allocated to someone else which we found out when we tried to access the room Rooms were generally small and not clean to the standard expected for a 4 hotel In general I felt we paid more than we should have for what we got,0
 There was a girl working in the restaurant and we asked her a few things about the dessert but she didn t know alot The staff that evening didn t walk by our table once and when they did they didn t take our plates The staff the next day though was more experienced and very outgoing So our dinner of the night before was immediately forgotten and we had a great night at your restaurant ,0
 Great location and lovely room ,1
 the staff was very nice and hotel looks great from outside but not so much inside rooms ,1

 When we arrive after a long day we were told that I had booked two rooms which was incorrect there was only myself and me sister in law so we only needed one room We informed we would have to pay for both rooms until I spoke with an operator at your office and the hotel finally decided to cancel the extra room but for about an hour we were very worried that we had to pay for two rooms But got sorted in the end Also no airport shuttle so should say so on ads ,0
 Good location with easy access to Paddington Station and other tube stations and bus routes nearby Short walk to Hyde Park Staff were very eager to please and helpful with extra tea coffee items in room umbrella loan taxi s etc Have stayed in this area several times before and this is a good hotel consistent with others in the area for the size of room and price A bit quieter than those closer to Bayswater Road Some really nice little pubs cafe s and restaurants around the area away from Paddington central ,1

 Good location especially for access to Paddington Station for the Heathrow Express Also a short walk to Notting Hill and Portobello Road The night staff are lots of fun and provide great service Angels overnight Julian Carlos Claudio Agnelo It being close to Halloween Count Dracula was roaming the lobby and bar Our initial room smelled of cigarette smoke in spite of it being a non smoking hotel Thankfully they changed our room with no issue We had reserved a club room and were pleased to find a box of chocolates in addition to the wine and fruit bowl ,1
 The staff is excellent they went out of their way to make my stay pleasant and comfortable highly recommend them for that They deliver a genuine feeling of Old School London marvelous The location is perfect for bus underground and walking my externally booked Stonehenge tour also met up at this hotel making it extremely convenient ,1
 I was moved on arrival despite only booking that day Apparently there were maintenance issues but it didn t stop the group in front of me checking in The hotel I moved to was further away from where I needed to be small room was not the cleanest a bit tired and not somewhere I d have chosen to stay Overpriced and dissatisfied ,0

Rooms facing the lift suffer severely from the noise of the safety locking mechanism I relocated Wifi throughput erratic TV cables and remote had been removed by an earlier guest helpful and well meaning but not very efficient staff took 2 days to fix this Spa sauna steam room tiny have to ask for facilities to be switched on For 240 per night I would have expected the breakfast to involve something like an omelette without surcharge Little things like lights hinges taps would benefit from some adjustments,0
The room was a little cramped for 2 people considering the price that was payed for it,0
 High spec fitments and furnishings very clean helpful staff ,1
 Don t believe there was anything we didn t like My personal choice for marmalade at breakfast wasn t available but I was able to find something else amongst the spread choices to satisfy my palate so this isn t a complaint ,0
The rooms provided were small We had to upgrade for the bigger rooms Credit card details provided at time of booking via booking com was debited even though payment for the ris were made upfront This was only refunded after 96 hours blocking credit unnecessarily,0

 Good clean towels without visible stains,1
We have stayed here a few times but some areas of the hotel are looking a bit tired we were initially initially in room 119 but requested to be moved after the first night due to being woken at 7am by building work going on outside this was dealt with in a very professional manner by the reception staff and we were moved into 130 which met with our expectations also you have a resident mouse that likes to frequent the bar fairly late in the evening on a regular basis,0
 The bar was shut when I got back at midnight which seemed quite early for a hotel bar on a Saturday night in a city like Amsterdam ,0
This property is listed as accessible My daughter uses a manual wheelchair but is able to stand for very short periods THIS FACILITY IS ONLY ACCESSIBLE IF THEY SET UP A MOTORIZED DEVICE much like a stairway system installed in one s home Can you imagine the trouble it would be to have that device set up each time you came and went The embarrassment and time wasted cannot be estimated I ended up carrying my daughter s chair there was not always a doorman present up the 5 6 steps while my daughter hauled herself up and down using the railing This facility is not accessible unless you come and go once a day with scheduled times In fact when we first arrived a bellman told us there was not a way to get into the hotel w a wheelchair The staff requires education Later that evening the manager called and apologized for staff being unaware of the electric system Please change your listing to not accessible The table floor lamp was tipsy when we wrote on the surface it would almost tip over The bathroom appeared clean but the shower curtain smelled mildewed,0
Deluxe double was a small room Interior was back to the 70s TV was small and hardly viewable Front line staff were great but the managers appeared as honest as Arthur Daley No room for luggage Bathroom too small,0
 Couldn t open the windows to the room to let in fresh air and the pillows were too thin which made the sleep difficult,0
 Nice bathroom with big shower and bath Quiet if you get a room on the top floors ,1

The location isn t great bit far out from the centre and area surrounding hotel looks rough The hotel looked out of place there When upgrading to a suite with bathtub extra 25 one of the pillows was filthy A call to reception and a new pillow arrived within the hour But still not what you would expect Room service is very expensive and not good quality or as described on the menu,0

 The meat in the breakfast was pork so we couldn t eat it during our whole stay since we are muslims ,0
 Breakfast doesnt have enough selection ,0
 Nothing special ,0
 Rare for one of my posts but no faults zero the perfect stay ,0
 the location I would suggest the hotel to put a tip on their website on how to reach the hotel from the metro station when we first arrived we obviously have no idea which route we should take to reach the hotel and thus ended up walking pass a very dodgy rough and unsafe area more so when you walked at night,0

 The location in a quiet park with a great terrace The space and the rooms are exquisite with a lot of taste The gigantic beds pillows and bedsheets are super comfortable It s dark and silent which is something impossible to find in Amsterdam Staff was very friendly and accommodating The restaurant with a view over the park is great to work and eat,1
 The wardrobes were so high and in an awkward place neither I nor my mother were able to use them luckily we were only staying one night ,0

 Hard to find something wrong Breakfast not included in price,0
 Location of the Hotel is very good very close to public transportation,1
 It was quite a small room clean and quiet but with not a lot of space Overnight it was very cold We asked for and received an extra blanket and a heater on the second night but shouldn t have needed to ask for it ,0
 issues with Media and TV Wifi could be better and for the price should be free for the best connection ,0
 Nothing to dislike,0
 Having to share a double bed instead of twin as advertised,0
we had a meal for 4 people in the Italian restaurant sadly the meal wasn t to a very good standard my main course was not cooked properly I did complain to be told that red bloody chicken was a normal way to serve baby chicken a lot of money for a meal that left 2 men still hungry over priced a complete let down,0
 the bathroom is very small so there wasnt enough room to put my toiletries ,0
 The bathroom was quite small,0
The ceiling in the room was leaking water in two spots in the toilet and beside the air conditioning The cleaning service threw away a hair conditioning of ours and the hotel did not have one to replace it Also there were many bags of garbage from the cleaning service blocking the lift s door and in the middle of the corridor Not very pleasant at all In the Eve s overnight the card did not open the reception door and we got stuck outside the hotel for 10 minutes at a negative temperature until someone opened the door,0
On arrival I was sent to another hotel down the road by the girl on reception as there was a problem with the boiler and my room was not available Although I asked for another room I was told there wasn t one that I would have to go to another hotel down the street for the first night that was of an equivalent standard When I got to the other hotel it was nothing like the one I d paid for and was 90AUD cheaper per night I asked to be transferred back to the hotel I d paid for they did have another room the gentleman on the desk was very apologetic This all could have been avoided was very upsetting at the time Fridge would be handy,0
 Decor was a little worn and in need of maintenance ,0
 A boutique style hotel It had a lovely garden Nice touch with a tablet in the room for wifi use Complimentary fresh fruit plate for us The breakfast was superb Gorgeous serving sparkling dishes and plates Quiet location but within minutes of bustle ,1
 Location was good and within easy walking distance of transport Restaurant was ok and staff were friendly and helpful ,1
 Nothing,1
 The bed mattress was too hard without the mattress topper on which we removed because it made us hot The mattress was orthopaedic firm,0
 the size of the room is small for Americans but pretty standard for Europe ,0
The price per night is very good relatively to other 4 stars hotels in London The location is very good 2 minutes walk from Earl s Court metro station at Piccadilly line one of the longest metro line in London direct from the Heathrow airport And to all the popular locations in London Near the Hotel there is 2 big supermarket 4 5 good restaurants and 3 cafes The hotel very clean modern and new The breakfast very good not too expensive for full English Breakfast 15 per person At any cafe you ll probably pay the same price or more The bathroom in the rooms big enough and clean This is my second time I m staying in the k k hotels in Europe they are very good,1
 Our double room was dated only view was of a collection of air con units the tiniest bathroom ever to run a bath one had to get in to do so poor shower once you could get it going basin area so small was difficult to wash face and teeth Disgusting dirty grouting between basin and shower screen Breakfast area congested and two mornings in a row had to ask for bread Totally underwhelmed by this place ,0

 Pricey but I suppose it is London One small point used the bath and although there was no visible dirt in it when I got in it was obvious that it hadn t been cleaned since the last person had used it ,0
 Great location for NYE celebrations and only a short walk into Covent Garden etc Really nice spacious and well equipped room Helpful and friendly staff Would happily stay here again ,1
The only thing was that I had asked for a piece of chocolate cake with 2 candles a 3 and a 0 and was promised that it would be taken care off but when we arrived at the hotel I was told that there is no chocolate cake and that they dont have candles A bit dissapointed there cause I would have taken care of it if not promised otherwise,0

Location not far from Gard de Nord otherwise somewhat out of the way until we found our way around the Metro which was good Breakfast not impressive little choice coffee not hot Bar had limited opening times closed early so no customers no atmosphere D cor seating was good so if the management put some effort into it would do a lot better Ice Bar was a great novelty but at 18C we didn t fancy it perhaps next time we will brave it Also a kettle in the room would be helpful,0

 Everything The friendly staff super comfortable bed we did not want to get out of bed in the morning it was so comfortable the artsy decor of the hotel chic bar It was truly pleasant to stay in Hotel Arena,1
Breakfast the chef spent to much time tallkiing I waited 20 minutes for an egg and there was only 1 person in front of me this is the wrong system for eggs and omelettes he only did 1 person at a time when he could have put 8 eggs on at the same time kept 4 people happy,1
We stayed last year and our room was nicer didn t like the view from 246 the machines heaters or what ever they were noisy However would still stay again,0
Hi standard of accomdation Staff were very attentive and good attention to detail with luxury extras provided Only a 10 min walk to Covent Garden Very near to the Royal Courts of Justice Somerset House and the Strand,1
 Perfect location for our morning spent at the British Museum ,1
 Expensive breakfast stairs in front of the hotel made it very inconvenient to disabled people and guests with heavier luggage,0
 The location as well as the breakfast ,1
 Originally booked a room with twin beds for my granddaughter and me However the only window faced an interior wall no way to tell the weather So I had to change the accommodation ,0
 Small room and shower ,0

 The reception are not polite and some of them don t know what to do when they meet up with any kind of problems Definitely I ll never ever stay there again even still water is not available in this hotel When you ask reception that can I have a bottle of water You will got right away this answer We have got glass in the room and you can drink tab water believe me never try tab water Tasty like stream water honestly it was terrible staying Even if you want to leave one day early they will never refund your money back You have to pay exactly how many days you think at beginning ,0
 Our room was on the basement floor and there was a noise coming through the air vent the entire night which made it very difficult to sleep ,0

 It was a quirky hotel in terms of innovative way they used space including the room itself and breakfast room,1

 Initially we were provided with two very poor rooms Neither had curtains only blinds which did not close properly The compact room was extremely small and had a musty smell The deluxe double could in no way be described as deluxe Among other things the carpet at the entrance of the shower room was very wet ,0
The location is exceptionally good You can rule out every cons just with the location Only 10 15 minutes away from Oxford Street which is the main shopping area in London The place is very nice and calm The hotel provide with Here mobile device that you can carry it around the city with you in which it provides unlimited data and local calls with many information about I could take it around the city and search the web including the map Very clean traditional style hotel Very warm nice staffs that speaks different languages We could keep our luggage behind the desk for free of charge until we get back to take off to airport,1

 The location nearby was not really nice ,0
The door into the room would not open fully because of the wardrobe The bedrooms were tiny one side of the bed was only 25cm away from the wall and a radiator was stuck out from that leaving 16cm up the side of the bed We had asked for larger rooms and they tried to charge us extra for this I refused to pay any extra as I couldn t beleive there were any smaller rooms,0
 The hotel is no air condition it s too hut you can t sleep or stay in room no way to get more it s better to look for another hotel,1
 Saif and quit,1
Breakfast was a little over priced but we did get a 25 discount,0
Staff gave directions to Battersea which took us on 2 tubes and a taxi costing us approx 25 and took us an hour making us late When we went to come back we discovered it was a train directly to Waterloo costing 5 and took 15 minutes Not impressed with poor advice,0
I filled in the request form to reserve a parking place although the site says reservation is not needed On arrival no reserved parking place because I only made a request Lousy no wifi on 5th floor no cleaning of room after complaining they told us the maid had gone home,0

 Beautiful building courtyard was stunning Marvellous location just a short walk from Temple tubestation along the Thames very pretty The staff were friendly and polite the receptionist asked us if we were there for a special occasion it was my boyfriends birthday They delivered handmade chocolates to our room with a happy birthday message which made the visit extra special The lobby area was also exquisite very sleek and modern with glass doors showing a contrast between the old courtyard walls and the modern interior that now sat within it The design of the space left a long lasting impression The rooms were spacious and clean plus there was complimentary tea and coffee ,1
 Very good location and view which we had luckily Clean room and toilet Good food in the restaurant ,1

Upon arrival we turned AC on freshened up and went out for the day When we returned AC was still not working London was going through a heat spell Called front desk someone came up with a fan and told us there was nothing they could do so we suffered in the warmth of the night Did not help that windows were only able to open about 3 inches Next morning as we were preparing to head out maintenance came informed them to stop back as we were getting ready to leave for the day When we returned later that night AC still did not work I was told that it would not be repaired until the following week after I went to front desk to complain My family was later moved to two separate rooms at 11 00 at night instead of one room This is a very old hotel and it shows We were comped breakfast for two days for three people for our inconvenience Overall I would not recommend this place,0

So lets start from the weird thing that happened in one of the rooms we were staying One person in our group got 220v electric chock which went through her hands It came from water boiler or lamp due to either a bad wireing faulty socket lamp or water boiler Luckily the rooms fuse discharged and cut the electricity in the room immediately The hotel covered doctor expences were very sorry about what had happened and send a fruit basket to a room They also let us have a late check out for free of charge Thats all of the compensation we had In my opinion the compensation was not that big for endangering a life of guest or what do you think The managemt had a chance to read and comment my review before i posted it The hotel management answered that this electric problem is now fixed but its still unclear if they checked other renovated rooms for faulty wireing too It anyway seems that the management does not worry about this that much since the management said that they did nor endanger any lives in the hotel Ofcource the managent was also very sorry in the answer about what had happened Some information gaps there seemed to be between the manager and the personnel since the cleaner came to ask us when are we leaving and the keys stopped working before the time we had been granted to leave Picture is from bathroom lamp that had nothing to do with the insident but such wireing was visible in the rooms,0
Beautiful hotel staff were very friendly and helpful Brilliant Location 2minties walk to a tube station and right opposite Russell Square gardens Would definitely stay again,1

 The quality of the hotel was brilliant and even though it was under renovation there was no disruption or noise The location of the hotel is far enough away from the centre of the city that it did not feel like a tourist trap and it is also situated in a fantastic park near some great bars and restaurants I cannot fault the staff facilities or the price and would highly recommend this to anyone ,1

Very pleasant hotel Excellent staff Good very quiet location 200 yds to Earls Court tube station,1
 Room was cold the warm air heating struggled to keep up with a very cold spell in London and the thermostat controls are impossible to understand The hotel clearly has problems getting cleaning staff to work on Saturday Our room was not ready on time Having said that the staff were quick to find an alternative room albeit a cold one ,0
 Large rooms and convenient location Helpful staff ,0
 The staff were amazing ,1
 From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were looked after really well Nothing was too much troubleReception staff were very freindly and hall porter and concierge also Had a drink in the bar on the Saturday night and again very freindly and helpful lovely atmosphere in the bar ,1

 The Lobby is small ,0
 Slow service in the bar early morning I wanted a coffee to go but simply didn t really want to serve opened a few cupboards looking for take away cups so I said I d leave it and I got one elsewhere ,0
 The room was very small with narrow stairs inside the room door leading up to the bed The floor was creaky and the walls were thin leading to noise from other rooms ,0
The hair dryer was attached to a unit that was positioned approximately 8 feet away from the dressing table This is too far away when trying to style your hair Fortunately I had taken my own hair dryer The lighting in the room was too low It would have been helpful to have had a bright light positioned by the dressing table to make drying of hair and putting on of make up that much easier,0
 The location was phenomenal The accommodations were amazing as well ,1
The air conditioner made a bird noise constantly We had someone look at it it stopped for about 30 min and started again We previously stayed at this hotel for the past 5 years this year the room was tatty we asked for an early check in by 1 2 hour the room was not ready for 1 hour after we arrived I do not believe we will stay there again I don t believe it was good quality for the price,0
 Hotel Russell is a lovely old hotel with a wonderful location minutes to the British Museum and with the tube right around the corner The standard double was fine clean comfortable and roomy enough for our week in London My wife especially appreciated the deep tub in the large bathroom ,1
 Decor and condition of rooms dated and tired Very small room but I guess it is London ,0
 We felt that the bathroom was missing several items that you would expect to find in such a hotel I e Toilet brush shower cap cotton wool face cloths The room had a very narrow window looking out over a boiler or something similar This was supposed to be a superior room but that was hard to believe ,0

 The airconditioner was warm and I found out just on the last night when I asked for a fan that the temps can be dropped by the staff It would have been nice to know that is advance pre authorization on your CC is needed in advance if u want to order room service Should be part of the initial CC pre authorization I shouldn t be paying each time I order something ,0

 The location made it easy for us to get a nice snap shot of London,1
Impossible not to like this hotel Great staff super breakfast which is free for kids and even cheaper if you pre book at check in We also used room service who provided a delicious supper at sensible prices The staff even prepared a lovely little chocolate cake for our daughter s birthday with a signed card a great little detail We were initially booked into room 1024 which faces onto the Westminster Plaza dark and dank plus the windows were so dirty you couldn t see out of them To be fair the staff were very flexible and offered us a tour of alternative rooms We decided on a junior suite room 1027 which looked out on Big Ben County Hall and the Eye It did cost 20 more but if you re doing this trip just once go for it Worth noting that the traffic here isn t too busy at night and a taxi back is not too expensive,1
 the right elevator is in the need of maintenance,0

 location not worth it,0
 Location is great ,1
 I did not like breakfast at all Except the omletes cooked by chief Restoran for the breakfast very small so creates long waiting list in front of restaurant ,0
 Staff helpfulness,1
 I didn t like being asked to move hotels as they had a boiler problem I was also disappointed that the large lounge area with open fire which I had enjoyed on a previous stay was closed off and we couldn t use it ,0
 I picked this up the day before arriving so the on line offer was too good to miss out on ,1

 View from room of the London eye ,1
We were switched hotels at the last minute and no one notified us Rooms were too small It s very likely they are the same size at all these same chains We had 3 adults and a baby with a baby bed Even without the baby bed there was hardly any room to walk through the room but we made it work However it was a nice place to stay in a decent location Lancaster Gate Station underground was closed when we were there or that would have been nice also,0
No Negative,0
 The hotel provides outstanding service and is in the heart of the theatre district and just steps from The Savoy Hotel Covent Garden Martket and a bridge to the West Bank with all its food carts Excellent restaurants surround the hotel and the hotel itself houses outstanding restaurants and a bar with novalty drinks served until midnight ,1
 Location,1
 Very peaceful and quiet would not believe you were so close to the main roads Staff extremely friendly helpful Everything was spotless and clean Rubber duck is a great gimmick children loved taking him on our travels and taking pictures ,1
 The staff member who checked us in was fantastic his name was Miles and he was so lovely helped us enormously and scored us some cake for the room A winner in my book Even free glasses of wine as our room was not ready at the stated time ,1
 Room was comfy Breakfast was good ,1
 No real complaints the hotel was great great location surroundings rooms amenities and service Two recommendations however firstly the staff upon check in are very confusing regarding deposit payments and the staff offer you upon checkout to refund your original payment and you can make a new one Bit confusing Secondly the on site restaurant is a bit lacking very well thought out and excellent quality food for anyone of a vegetarian or vegan background but even a wrap or toasted sandwich option would be great Aside from those minor minor things fantastic spot and will be back when i return to Amsterdam ,1

 The attitude of the staff during the check in The assumption that I wanted two single beds even though I booked a double room How the attitude of the staff changed when they found out we were a gay couple So called technical problem with the room I wouldn t recommend staying here ,0
The inside of the hotel is very classy He staff are friendly and helpful Our room was great Huge bathroom with double sinks and showers small sitting room with a kettle and fridge beautiful bedroom with a big comfortable bed The hotel is a nice area There is a big park next door and it is only a 20 minute walk to the Heineken Experience,1

 Standard Hotel,1
We were asked if we wanted to upgrade to a studio with a view of the London eye It was 25gbp per night but the view was obstructed and not worth the extra outlay in my opinion,0
 Comfy beds room was lovely ,1
We had a broken cold tap in the bathroom which couldn t be repaired that day We booked an alarm call for 6 30am which came late There was no trouser press in the room We had paid extra for an upgrade WE,0
 The staff were very nice There was a mistake with our room and since it was my boyfriends birthday they gave us an even better room with complimentary wine for both of us Was really special I only stayed a night for the occasion Wish i stayed longer ,1
 The room is too warm cooling is not in use duting the heating season The hotel still uses its famous breakfast in marketing That is almost a fraud The breakfast is not nearly what it used to be It was okay but not a reason to come any more The location still is a reason ,0
 There was nothing that we can think of The room key is very large and there is only one They ask that you turn it in when you go out It s a little eccentric but OK ,0
 No water to drink in spa area Room on small side compared to advertised twin room Kettle plug dangling not obvious where to plug in ,0

the only thing that would of been better is if i had booked more nights But apart from that there is not really much I dislike about the Hotel I suppose if there is one thing the room I had did not have a view only other rooms but I dont tend to go on holiday to sit in my hotel room staring out the window so not really a great deal I can find that I did not like plus stayed for 2 nights and this place was perfect for that,0
 Room got quite warm so left windows open when out as aircon is noisy,0

 Kippers they forgot our order and when they came they were very small and dry Try Loch Fyne kippers Best not to have kippers on the menu if they are not up to standard ,0

 Room spacious and clean Air of grandeur about the hotel ,1

 Generally clean and interestingly designed But a little worn Meanwhile there is massive renovation underway which will probably make it a much nicer hotel but in the meantime you will walk up a wooden ramp to reception and many amenities are in process The reason to stay here is that it s cheaper than other similar properties possibly because it s in renovation and also because it is off the beaten path though not in a bad neighborhood just not close to the hot spots ,1
 Staff were super nothing was too much trouble Professional but approachable Lovely comfy bed so great night s sleep ready to explore all the places of interest so close to the hotel,1

 Our stay at The Grand Royale marked the start of our honeymoon we arrived to a bottle of wine chocolates a selection of fruit and a handwritten card in our room The staff were attentive and pleasant and we were allowed a late check out at no extra cost Breakfast was superb with a huge choice of cooked or continental options We loved the building with its extensive wood panelling and beautiful friezes on walls and ceilings the history of the building made for interesting reading too We were delighted with our choice of hotel and will return when we next visit London we highly recommend The Grand Royale ,1

The room was a bit small and warm as only 1 window of the 3 could be opened for only 3 inches Our room was on the side of the hotel and the morning sun makes the room so hot Bathroom was a bit disappointing Small very tine sink next to bath like u have in your house in a downstairs toilet your elbow touches the wall when brushing teeth or cleaning face shower head is the old fashioned the one attached to the wall so you cant take the head down,0

 I had a room on the top floor which actually gave me a rooftop view of Paris Unfortunately it was like being in an attic the sloped roof took up half of the small room It was difficult to navigate around the very hard bed to get to the wardrobe and I had to stand on a chair to use the safe It was also extremely hot even with the air conditioner running all of the time The windows did open but with no screens there were issues with mosquitos and birds flying in I didn t change my room because I didn t spend much time in it ,0

 My bag was stolen from the hotel lobby and that speaks a lot on poor management and lack of security It took the hotel half an hour to view the cctv footage and i think the response from the management was atrocious I lost a lot of money and as a traveler it was a nightmare to be in an alien city without any help from the management The management did not even apologies for what has happened I would advise Booking com to withdraw the hotel from their system and also advise travellers to not to stay at this hotel Imagine a bag being stolen from the lobby of the hotel Very poor attitude and shockingly unbelievable behaviour ,0

Housekeeping would bang on your door to wake you up at 830am This is your alarm Very frustrated They will continue banging till you wake up until you told them not to clean up your room in such a morning hours Terrible If we need clean up we would put the paper sign out to make up room No respect on guests Don t expect this Housekeeping will refill your bath gel they only keep those bottles which you don t want to use keep on giving you the same unwanted bottles say conditioner They won t give you slippers cotton pads tho they keep it in their trolley They won t refill your tea sugar when u finished your stay was more than 6 days Doubt they changed your bedsheets too in such a long week,0

We arrived in the early hours to check in after paying a taxi to take us to front door we were asked to walk to their sister hotel down the street where they then tried to check us in again and charge us again Then headed down to our room where the key card didn t work so headed back to reception they then came down with us and it still didn t work so told us to wait at the room They then returned and manually opened our door and said it couldn t be fixed until the next day It then soon dawned on us that we wouldn t be able to go for breakfast as we wouldn t be able to get back in our room The bed clearly hadn t been changed as there were other peoples hairs in the sheets and pillows my bedside table also had what I can only describe as orange zest all over it This was at 02 30 am so we decided to grin and bare as we were shattered Then the morning came our wake up call of a fire alarm at 09 00 wasn t exactly pleasant followed by the cleaners ringing the door bell several times and getting us out of bed even though we had until 12 00 to check out We left and couldn t get out fast enough after a very bad experience we found ourselves on a street we hadn t planned to be on with no idea which way to head hopefully we wont stumble across this hotel again It really was a shame as it looked as if the place was actually run by someone who cares it could have been lovely But at the tune of 173 00 for less than 10 hours we wont ever be going back,0

 Staff a few were friendly and willing enough to help but we ran into one gentleman who seemed to be in training and was totally ineffective Every question we asked had to be referred to someone else he wouldn t make eye contact he wouldn t even just say I don t know the answer let me find out for you There didn t seem to be a manager around Unfortunately there is still a lot of construction going on so it is difficult to see what the building will be like when finished The temporary reception area is in a very small dark area under the central staircase too bad Breakfast was overpriced for a good but ordinary buffet ,0

When staying in a deluxe room guests have use of the Club Lounge except in our case due to the free upgrade I thought this was a bit mean spirited Also we were awoken at 8 20am on our last morning by maintenance but reception staff were unsure why however they offered us a free upgrade with their sincere apologies the next time we book with them,0

 Room was nice and contemporary the bathroom sliding glass door is not practical makes too much noise when opening and closing especially in the middle of the night when others are sleeping AND it is far from sound proof when showering and getting ready while others are still sleeping ,0
 the building work created a bad first impression of the hotel as had to enter through a back door through building mess would expect to be notified seating in room uncomfortable as had no back rest had to sit on floor with back against settee stairs steep to go to bathroom at night was a little precarious breakfast expensive in comparison to outside restaurants ,0

When we arrive the hotel we 3 rooms for 7 nights were asked to move to stay at another hotel because water warmer in our bathrooms don t work Without prior notice and without any other option even the booking has been done about 1 2 months in advance we were very disappointed It was unprofessional and unacceptable even the new hotel was not bad but we were inconvenience with its location far from tube station,0
We were there for 5 days it would be nice to have something different for breakfast not the exact same thing everyday There was only one elevator so sometimes it was a bit of a wait,0
 Outstanding customer service comfort in the rooms and the public areas of the Hotel and just that feeling of being made to feel welcome every day ,1

 Everything about the park grand was excellent From the moment we entered the door to the time we left we were made to feel welcome The room itself was fantastic comfortable immaculate and modern with everything you could possibly need The bathroom with underfloor heating was a lovely touch especially for my feet The restaraunt was lovely with a great choice of food and beverages wich were all very tasty Couldn t fault the service here and will definitely be returning ,1
 The hotel looked abit tired lots of scratches and market on the walls the floors in the room looked a little dirty and our room smelt very bad of dirty drains so bad we actually moved rooms,0
The hotel is rich in history and in great location for transportation food and entertainment The staff was very helpful The room itself was large for London and had AC But the bathroom was TINY and claustrophobic we were told all other floors had larger ones We would definitely stay there again but not in that room Laundry was available just a 5 minute walk away,1

 Very uncomfortable bathroom everything was very old very bad air conditioning,0
The room was extremely small and as were staying for 4 nights was extremely cramped I had requested an upper floor room but was given a room on the first floor which I do nor class as an upper floor Our room was at the back of the hotel directly opposite a pub It was extremely noisy until the early hours and then the noise began again prior to 7am when they were obviously taking the empty bottle out,0

 Hotel and rooms were beautiful My friend and I wanted some luxury on our trip to Amsterdam and this hotel provided just that The staff were extremely friendly and gave us lots of advice on where to go local life etc You will need to get trams metro from this hotel which all added to the experience of our trip Would definitely recommend this hotel ,1

The bathroom If it can be called that even Honestly it is just a cubicle with no demarcation for the shower just a shower curtain that you pull across but that certainly does not help as for sure there is water everywhere on the floor when you shower We had to put down 3 towels to soak it all up as it s a mess they could surely have increased the size by cutting down on the seating area of the room It was really very tiny though we were in the Club Room,0

 Being from australia we wanted a nineteenth century experience in a beautiful authentic olde world hotel It was all that The Lily Langtry theatre bar was outstandingly beautiful We had many gorgeous cocktails there amid the gilt and finery Loved it Although single rooms are small they are just enough and very comfortable The deep British bath was fabulous too ,1
 The location It was so close to the london eye and the rest of the popular attractions that it was easy for my wife to go with the kids while I attendend a course at the hotel The rooms were comfortable and fair enough space ,1
 We were made to move hotels because of hot water issues The mattress was yellow with stains If i had noticed this before the morning we certainly would not have stayed in that room I was informed the next day that they had thrown the mattress out it certainly couldn t have been cleaned The headboard was stained The staff were thoroughly unhelpful they couldn t even get me some new batteries for the remote control A second bed had been crowbarred into our room and made it impossible to open the fridge ,0

 good size room and even though I did not use it I liked that there was a kitchen area with a microwave ,1
 there was a cracked tile in the bathroom which dipped when you stepped on it also the basin tap was loose,0
 Maybe the staff could have introduced themselves by name on check in the create a more personalised check in,0
 Nothing really to complain about Breakfast is on an expensive side but we did not have it so cannot judge quality ,0
The location is good You need 15min to 20min walk to the center depends on your speed The hotel locates in a beautiful park and have a nice interior design The bed was really comfortable,1

 We chose that hotel because of its locations but the room was an interior one and the view was awful which was very disappointing Interior rooms shouldn t cost the same money The Windows weren t closing and some parts need refurbishment ,0
 Bed and room were comfortable if a little cramped Getting to the wardrobe was difficult with the table and chair in the way Linen good quality but again the bathroom was neat Beds although twins had to be touching to leave room at either side Glad windows opened but they could have done with cleaning or repainting Thermos flasks of tea at B F was brilliant idea Location of hotel made up for any negatives ,1

The bathroom had a smell of drains the whole time we were there If we left the bathroom door open then the whole room stank Informed reception who were very apologetic Also we arrived at the restaurant at 9pm and were told we couldn t use it as they had a booking of 15 people due It didn t look too busy as there were plenty of empty tables but we were told we had to use the bar instead so we went elsewhere,0
 The mattress on the sofa bed in the studio was filthy with at least five horrid blood stains The shower hose was leaking and the sink was dripping on to the scales stored under it Needless to say the scales had long stopped working as a result as they were soaked in water ,0

 The breakfast was fantastic and the staff were brilliant They were really friendly and always keen to help Very close to Queensway tube and on the doorstep to Hyde Park ,1
 Bathroom smelled of damp But was nicely fitted ,0
The room was quite dark and had too few electrical outlets If I needed to plug in my laptop I had to unplug the lamp as there was only one outlet near the desk That made the room even darker In 2015 a guest expects better Also your website says that the checkout time is 11 00 whereas according to the guest directory in the room it s 12 00 This inconsistency should be corrected,0
 The beds and pillows are not comfortable and under the sofa bed was not cleaned plastic bags and crackers and the shower box not cleaned well and a bit broken ,0
 I wish there had been space for a mini fridge The room was a tight fit for one adult and child Also I m sure it was a fluke but found evidence that the room had not been vacuumed from the guest who was there before us She must have had a lot of hair ,0

Unacceptable level of customer service Once we arrived we paid for an upgrade for a more spacious room with a view The room was indeed lovely yet the temperature in the room was extremely low it was FREEZING COLD They send us an engineer to fix the air conditioning system We spent approximately 2 hours calling at the reception and waiting for the engineer to finish his work waiting for the air conditioning system to be fixed At some point we had to leave the room because we had scheduled business appointments The hotel personnel reassured us that by the time we would be back everything would be fine At 11 30pm when we returned to the room we faced the same condition a freezing cold room We spent one hour fighting with the duty manager and the hotel personel till they brought us 2 portable heaters in the room and we eventually managed to heat the room with those heaters The air conditioning system never worked as the hotel personnel kept insisting,0

The underground Waterloo is very busy between 8 30 9 00 am we had to wait for six trains before we could ride along in a cart stuck like sardines in a can We arrived at the wrong chain reception showed us no smile at all didnt appoligized that we are at the wrong location She just did not care at all But this is the case in all London hotels I ve noticed Specially with the east European staff members Their accent showed through The sighing especially so rude Spending 200 a night should not give this service at all most annoying point was that we mentioned that we want a business invoice and mentioned it on booking com but they refuse to give us ons Only after consulting the manager we were granted what we wanted As a business traveler this is not convenient and very time consuming and annoying,0
 Staff were very friendly prompt check in good turn down service etc Good location close to river and Covent Garden Our room was spacious clean and very quiet Nice touches in the room like free champagne for our anniversary Reception responded promptly to all my emails prior to arrival,1

 The bed was comfortable there was enough light in the room to work often hotel lighting is not suitable The room was well equipped and a good size for London,1
 Because we stayed six days and ate the breakfast on site every day because we paid for the included breakfast it would have been nice if they had changed up the menu from one day to the next It would have been really great if they had offered French Toast pancakes or waffles sigh But that said we had no problem with being seated right away as some reviewers have And the food was fresh and hot with plenty available ,0
Attic room with windows so high up we couldn t see out Bathroom although clean was dated a bit 1990s and mixer tap didn t work on shower so water was either scalding or tepid I didn t realise this still happened in London,0

When I landed in London I received a call from Grande Royale Hyde Park booked via your website They informed me that they had maintenance issues and that they transferred me to another hotel with the same rating After visiting another hotel Paddington Hotel which was more distant from the Hyde park and looked like it should have 2 3 star rating I went back to the Grand Royal and demanded the room Magically the room was available About 30 smaller in size than the one I booked Towels with hair on Sorry its far from 4 star Disaster,0
 We had a fantastic stay at the K K George Very easy access to Earls Court tube which goes straight to Heathrow as well as being a great start to explore London easily Quiet street just behind the main shops and a lovely garden to have an evening drink in Room was very comfortable and well serviced Breakfast had lots of choice Really a lovely base for a holiday in London ,1
 Room clean but too small and not quiet Breakfast complete,1
 Lovely staff fair size room packed in essentials,1
 Shocking Cold dirty stains on curtains third room change as hairs found in beds noisy plumbing and humming in room avoid at all costs ,0
I have stayed several times at Park Plaza hotels in this exact area their are three within several hundred feet This being my first time at Park Plaza Country Hall I expected the same gold standard that I have experienced at the other hotels I was staying in the Penthouse on the top floor for the weekend which means I expect Penthouse level customer service I had several issues with house cleaning security and most significant of all was the decor in the Penthouse The Penthouse has an amazing view of Big Ben Parliament and London Eye The decor is staggeringly outdated and resembles a 70 s era theme room which is not what I believe they purposely set out to do All of this really soured my experience at a hotel chain that I exclusively choose to utilize when I am in London This experience may deter me from using this specific hotel during any future trips to London That being said I reached out to Hotel Management about my experience and they showed great concern which is in the what did you like section please read,0

 Great room and food friendly staff ,1
 The minibar was well stocked but the prices are unfairly high Make the price of drinks reasonable so the customers won t have to purchase the items from an outside source Also water runs on the bathroom floor after taking a shower Nothing a couple of towels won t fix though ,0
I stay every month and as always staff are very friendly polite and make you feel welcome Location is fantastic 2 mins walk from Queensway tube central Rooms are clean and spacious compared to other central hotels Food is basic but good and a great selection at the bar not too pricey either definitely recommend,1
 Noisy neighbours and banging doors but the staff handled the problem beautifully once I d rung through to reception and also the Manager spotted the notes when I was checking out and asked if the problem had been dealt with ,0

Was not told about the 30 extra per night they charged you get it back at the end of your stay but does not go back into your bank for a few days This needs to be brought to people s attention before they arrive,0
Room was tiny Designation of double superior suggests at least adequate size but it was easily the smallest we have ever stayed in Little more than 12 inches either side of the bed and not being able to open the wardrobe door is ridiculous,0
 Indian food was excellent,1
Toiletries were a bit scarce 1 bottle of each for a family of 4 is a bit too little had to ask housekeeping for more every time which they provided with no problems,0

Hotel clearly had issues at breakfast and couldn t cope at busy times with several guests waiting 45 mins for their cooked breakfast However hotel didn t charge and sent a quick email apologising,0
 Rooms at the front of the building can be noisy from the traffic on the main road below,0
Staff could ve been a bit more clued up failed to check my booking room assigned was not what I asked for I requested a double and on entering the room was given a twin So was offered a double in the lower ground it didn t smell very pleasant in the room and the mattresses need to be changed I was advised I had been upgraded This was probably due to the error made on check in however even though the room may have been bigger there were no extras in the room and the TV was much smaller Clearly not an upgrade I don t know I guess for 135 I was expecting a lot more for a 1 night stay On checking in I was asked to pay for breakfast as its more expensive on the day yet it was already part of the rate I didn t have the best start to staying here unfortunately And not even a helping hand with my bag considering the error of assigning me the wrong room laid with the hotel breakfast could ve been more fresh and hotter Appreciate I had arrived 25mins before it closed yet it was still in the valid timeset,0

 An incredibly comfortable bed in a really well appointed room And Cohen the Receptionist was highly professional friendly and polite Excellent hotel ,1
We arrived to a king bed when my girlfriend and I specifically wanted and booked twin beds The lag time in getting this handled was a bit annoying because the desk clerk did not take this seriously enough Evidently he does not travel because he was very disrespectful of our request and a bit argumentative Car to airport did not arrive Agostinho was not on duty and we waited at least 20 minutes prior to getting into a cab I personally checked on the car about 10 minutes prior to departing and he had not arrived which I found unusual for Great Britain but then at the specific time and he still was not there I felt that a call should have been made promptly rather than waiting for us to have to ask 10 minutes later Hopefully these comments can be taken in a positive way to help improve customer service for this very nice facility,0

 We booked a suite intending that our young child would sleep on the sofa bed In the event it was too small and we asked that it be replaced by an extra bed This request was declined on health and safety grounds which appeared implausible An alternative but smaller room was offered with an extra charge for an extra bed which did not address the reason why the junior suite had been booked in the first place,0
It did take 3 attemps to get firm pillowes for are beds They need to be a bit more clearer some were be it on the web sight or checking Iin about the extra surcharge put on hold on the credit card I did get confused,0

Hotel needs more than location to be good Hire better staff Worst hotel ever I had booked penthouse suite for 1 night I would never ever use park plaza brand anywhere in the world Park plaza county hall should be a case study on how to lose customers Check in Early check in request was met with callous attitude the front desk seemed to enjoy the ordeal seeing us in distress of red eye from Washington with an ill family member All the front desk members were doings were enjoying my frustration Asked me to come back at 2PM as the policy stated I walked in exactly at 2PM guess what room wasn t ready Excuses and stories followed I didn t expect early check as a right but 2 problems 1 attitude of staff 2 weren t ready with room even as per written policy They played usual practice of offering me free breakfast which I refused and did not use Room Poor and dated furnishing Cheap furniture wardrobe doors did not close Air condition thermostat buttons don t work for setting the desired temperature you have to call the desk and tell them and they set it from maintenance room somewhere Room was freezing again at night causing my family members sickness grow bad and no one could sleep Silver lining Checkout was smooth with nice staff manager intervened during check in and tried to damage control sounded more constrictive and sensitive Hotel needs to hire such people everywhere,0

Carpet was a little shabby and bathroom had seen better days but these are not cheap or easy fixes The room was internal and the only window faced onto the Restaurant so there was no natural light Not a problem for me pitch black makes me sleep like the dead but my sister wasn t keen But for only 2 nights it was perfectly liveable,0

 Great location near to metro cleanliness of room and bathtub separate from shower and separate from bathroom ,1
 The shower was slightly faulty but we told the staff and they will be giving us some money back The room could ve been slightly cleaner in places and the refurbishments going on meant that the hotel was surrounded by construction works But very good value for money ,0
 Great location really near to Earls Court tube station and restaurants Friendly staff and wonderfully comfortable beds Nice hotel with modern touches Definitely stay again ,1

 The cost of food is very expensive ,0
 We shared a room with my brother who was visiting and the hotel provided a pull out sofa bed That was fine Unfortunately the pullout bed was near the window and the regular bed was nearest the door My wife and I slept on the pullout bed just because of the access to windows and natural light I thought that the main bed should be closest to the window instead of the sitting area pullout bed Seemed like a bad layout plan The pullout bed was tolerable but we cannot comment on the main bed because we didn t sleep on it ,0
 Very old shower,0
 Very good location nice quiet neighbourhood Friendly staff and good breakfast ,1

 A great hotel in a beautiful old terrace building We had a club room which was modern and spacious with large windows Bed was amazingly comfortable Walking distance to Paddngton Station and Heathrow Express ,1
 this beautiful building has huge potential but you get the feeling that while the extention work is going on the hotel is less of a priority It is starting to look frayed at the edges But there is a good and funky atmosphere and the breakfast was very good The location was also perfect for us as we were visiting relatives nearby and it is also a quite airy part of amsterdam ,1
 paint is pilling in our room ceiling constant noise of slamming doors due to the aggressive automatic door closer ,0

I booked a double deluxe room here online but when I got there they gave me a small room the size of a closet because it was available first even though I had paid the price point for a double deluxe room 450 pounds a night They then transferred me to a slightly bigger room that still wasn t a double deluxe and looked nothing like in the pictures Staff were rude and reluctant to help whenever spoken to and at one point in the lounge area we witnessed one of the staff giving a young hotel guest a loud and stern lecture about payment the whole exchange was very uncomfortable and unprofessional For 450 pounds night 800 Canadian dollars we would have gotten a spacious room in other countries with wonderful service but here I felt like I had thrown a bunch of money down the drain,0
Great hotel in good location fairly near theatres St Paul s Tate Modern The City River Thames The Shard half hour walk to Trafalgar Square a bit more to Soho Oxford St Nice to walk along the river to Westminster or get a boat 10 15min taxi from St Pancras Fairly quiet district for London but not much happening in the immediate location,1

 Had to change rooms twice once because the bath had a chip in it the mirror had a big crack across it and the alternative room given was tiny for the price paid I feel the up keep of some of the rooms is quite poor given the star rating of the hotel We also had to pay to upgrade to a better room which I don t think was fair given the rooms we were offered originally and the quality of them,0
The hotel is great The staff was friendly and very helpful actually this is one of the reasons that I will visit the hotel again The room superior double 5th floor was excellent and it had a small balcony overlooking a courtyard Considering the central location it was quiet with a nice view of the rooftops Very clean good sleep And I liked it aesthetically It has a unique style for example nice colors in the rooms the elephant and the cow outside the hotel I would definitely recommend it,1

The hotel arranged for a taxi to take us to the station at a fixed price of 25 00 it was a private firm and not a London black cab Although the driver was very pleasant and got us to the station on time the car itself absolutely stank of cigarette smoke Not pleasant,0

 Amazing service great staff The rooms were great and all of my requests were met and exceeded Deco is beautiful and location extremely convenient I appreciated the peace and quiet of the location,1
 Hardly any tea coffee in the room and a charge at reception for more for the coffee machine The restaurant attached was very expensive and at night there isn t anywhere nearby to eat you need to take the metro to another area ,0
 The property is conveniently located near Paddington station It was very easy to get to the airport by Heathrow express ,1
 very well located in between St Michel and Luxembourg Staff was nice and smiling,1
 When we first checked in they gave us a tiny twin room which is not what we had asked for Once we came back down and asked to be switched rooms we got a far nicer room probably twice the size with a kingsize bed so not sure why we weren t given to us straight away as we are clearly a couple Also for the price it would have been nice to have been provided with breakfast or at least some toiletries other than soap we had forgotten our toothpaste ,0
 Very small room with difficult wifi access,0
 Great location great price for London but most of all the staff were great all very friendly and happy to help,1
 Stayed for Wembley NFL game can t fault the place ,1
 Perfect location You can walk to pretty much all the tourist attractions London Eye Big Ben Buckingham Palace Tower Bridge as well as the shopping streets Covent Garden Oxford Street Hotel itself is very clean Nice personal The restaurant bar and roomservice are also good ,1
 Would of liked a better view,0
 What s with the breakfast confusion Can t British hoteliers just run a restaurant if they want to charge for breakfasts It was one price if booked the day before A higher price that morning Oops you re not on the list blah blah blah North American hotels have no problems dealing with this Put it on your room or pay on the spot No dual pricing So easy Please break the UK mode and make it easy ,0
 size of the room is so bad,0
 Breakfast was excellent,1
 Not once during our four day stay including when we arrived to check in did any staff member speak to us before being spoken to first We were the only guests in the reception area when we checked in Not one single welcome good morning or hello in four days And we were not disgruntled or asking for any special requirements It was a very nice property but that indifferent attitude was a striking difference from every other small hotel and B B in which we stayed on this three week UK vacation We would not recommend K K Hotel George nor would we return ourselves ,0
Staff were very helpfull Hotel was clean Location close to 2 underground stations Bayswater and Queensway Close to shops and Hyde Park,1
 Good location Along the Fleet Street and in the Temle And I like the atmosphere of this hotel ,1
Small for a family of 4 A little over priced for what you get however expected for that time of year Not enough pillows House keeping knocked at our door fairly early which was disappointing as we just flew for 24hours,0
 The biggest issue for me and my group with this hotel is the fact the staff do not appear to have a good command of English and this was hugely frustrating Not only did we stay but we had a huge meeting there with them too It was starting to drive us insane them not understanding simple instructions from us forgetting refreshments etc there is a lack of attention to detail at this hotel too and I do think the language barrier plays a big part in this For this reason alone I sadly will not be coming back ,0
room could have been bigger the bed was a little hard for my taste although it seemed good quality the 8th floor is not directly accessible by lift you have to go to the 7th and then up a couple of flights of stairs no minibar or fridge we stayed in a deluxe room,0
The location is really the best There are lots of places to eat and close to the metro as well You re a 10 15 minute walk away from the Notre Dame as well Our room was lovely Comfy beds and enough space for 2 girls with way more luggage than necessary We also had a view of the Eiffel Tower which was a super surprise when we looked out of the window Perfect,1
 We found our bedroom a club room with complimentary wine water fruit a little on the small side the bathroom was a bit cramped too However they were both clean so we shouldn t grumble ,0

When we booked hotel back in Jan 16 we requested room with a view of London eye In November had email to say our room did not have a view We could upgrade for 300 a night Unfortunately we could not cancel booking without loosing full amount So we had no choice We were on Level 4 and waited on average 20 30 minutes for 1 of 4 lifts Really bad On arrival we were offered Breakfast at an additional cost which we agreed on First morning there was a que of about 45 minutes for a seat in the dining room Not what I would have expected for this class of hotel,0
 Comfortable quiet and clean rooms,1

This hotel is supposed to be a 4 accommodation However given our experience it can be said it s no more than 2 We booked a deluxe twin room with 2 twin beds When we arrived there we got a twin room with one bed We told the front desk about this They reacted very customer unfriendly and told us there was no such thing like a twin room with two twin beds They also said that this was not their responsibility and that we should have booked from their own site and not with booking com because the information on their own site is supposedly correct We were very upset about their reaction and wanted to cancel the booking but the booking was already paid for and they said that we were free to go but they would not give our money back First they offered us to look for a room type we wanted in one of their other Park hotels When we asked them to do this they took a step back and said that they would charge us extra for this So we had to accept the room anyhow They also said that they were fully booked and there was no other room available however on every online hotel site there was the possibility to book an room on the same day More interestingly we made the booking in Euros and were charged more than 20 Euros more than our initial booking without any explanation When we were settled in the room it seemed to us the room was very cold and that the heater did not work The heater was blowing cold air even that we set it on maximum heat temperature Remarkably we discovered an electrical heating unit in the closet When we called the reception that the heater did not work they first said it was working OK and that we would have to wait to heat up That did not happen the room was only getting colder because the blower just blew cold air Mid januari in London that is not nice We called again and finally somebody came and said there was indeed a malfunction However they told us not being able to repair it until next day,0
 Breakfast was poor and uninspiring with limited selection wouldn t bother with it next time Also more expensive to buy it on booking com than at the hotel,0

 The breakfast was not good Taking a run of the mill buffet breakfast and turning in to something special is not complicated and creates a memorable moment that the hotel could be famous for At the moment processed scrabbled eggs cardboard bacon and over baked rolls are not the way forward Unfortunately the pineapple juice had turned and was undrinakable having said all of that the staff were nice ,0
The double deluxe room was not like the picture it s very small and I felt like I was in a prison cell when I complained the staff did their best to upgrade me to a bigger room however I did feel like it was false advertising to begin with we requested one of the rooms to have 2 single beds they called this a twin room and made us pay 50 more for 2 nights however it was still a double bed or as they call it 2 single beds on one base not sure what the point of that is,0

The room was tiny really small it barely fitted the bed in it really The window was not very secure or soundproof heatproof was old and breezy But my main gripe is that on arriving I was told I have to provide a credit card I didn t have the same card on me as I booked with so embarrassingly had to use my partners however despite the hotel being paid for in full they then charged my partners card without telling us for the full amount When I got home I noticed that I had been charged twice and I phoned them up which took over an hour of being kept waiting on hold to be then told that yes there is a mistake and it will take 6 days for the money to be returned to my account It would have been a nice stay but it was marred by these issues,0
 Room is quite small for the price ,0
 Comfortable spacious room Cleanliness overall Lovely shower ,1
 I did not like very much The location was good There was a good shower That is about it ,1
 No opening windows a c unit was making a bit of noise ,0

Rooms small and our children were placed in a room round the corridor which was away from our room we had asked for rooms close by breakfast waited 20 minutes before having to ask for coffee and tea crowded breakfast room and guest who had pre paid for breakfast were turned away,0
 Surprisingly modern inside the rooms close to the tube and clean ,1
 Typical London hotel in historical building Friendly staff Good location Value for money Pictures of the hotel on web site are real ,1
No Positive,1
 Very welcoming at reception and helpful great room facilities,1
The location was amazing We weren t too sure how far it would be away from everything considering it was over the river Not at all superior location and only a 5 min walk over the bridge Amazing hotel for families They are extremely accommodating to kids,1
 Excellent location Hyde Park just across the road restaurants of Queensway round the corner The lounges and bars are very atmospheric in a Jacobean sort of way panelled and dark but very relaxing The staff are pleasant and generally helpful The price is reasonable given the location ,1

 the hotel room was filthy and infested with bugs Had to be moved into another room which wasn t very nice either ,0
 Central location,1
 Not keen on the steps up to the front door is there an alternative entrance for mobility impaired ,0
 The hotel was undergoing a refurbishment and needs it in a lot of areas We were offered a choice of rooms including a quiet room This turned out to be a pokey double bedroom at the front of the hotel facing onto the square with single glazed windows Noisy all night bath did not drain and bathroom was pokey small Was changed to a better room on second night which was much better but beware of hit and miss and make sure to ask for a quality room ,0
 The Breakfast is excellent and staff very attentive Reception staff could be more cheerful and provide a more welcoming greeting the porters very helpful and friendly ,1
 Having to walk through smokers to get from rooms to reception ,0
Room exceptionally small and could be construed as dangerous Room was in a very confined space with 10 steep steps down to a miniscule bathroom with only just enough to squeeze in and I am of reasonably small build,0
Literally no wardrobe space We stayed for 4 nights and had to leave our clothes in suitcase Not sure it was value for money over New Years Eve The hotel decided to charge 109 00 for the buffet in restaurant on New Years Eve which I felt was cashing in on the whole event They wanted to charge an extra 700 for view upgrade which I thought was cashing in Bar very small no where to relax once a few families are in the bar,0
No Positive,1
 Very steep steps in room up to the bed not safe for children I asked to move rooms and was put in another identical one Room decoration was minamilist which I like but felt prison cell sparse,0
Lack of parking mitigated by valet service which however costs 45 for 24 hours which might put off some people,0
Everything you need to make a short break easy a decent hair dryer an iron that gets hot and you don t have to wait an hour for the bath to fill simple things that many London hotels still cannot provide in 2016 Cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in and very comfortable Almost 5 star,1
 Cost and location Air conditioning excellent ,1
 Waiting in a line for breakfast breakfast was poor room is to small for two beds no compliment water in room,0

 Cleaning staff changes our staff locations for example my wife arranged her makeup on the disk the moment we arrived but the cleaners take it and put it in the bathroom Very expensive compared to the service and the room and the facilities in the hotel The room was so small Very hot room there was no air conditioning in the hotel and they refused to open the A C because the manager closed it until our last night they opened it ,0
 Always consistent we know what to expect,1
Room is good comfy beds good size bathroom and toilet isn t massive but plenty of room for what is necessary Fridge and microwave so we could store our lunch for the day Area has a franprix and 5 minute walk to the metro so you can buy cheaper food to snack on and get to the centre relatively quickly,1

 Architecturally the building is terrific you can feel the history of the place which just isn t there with purpose built chain hotels The Arena has the look and feel of a boutique hotel lushly decorated wrought iron work on staircases chandeliers the up lighting and high windows and ceilings gives a great sense of space Location is fab in the green space of Oosterpark but only a ten min walk to the City Halls The rooms are quirky with a small footprint THe ground level has a closet small sofa WC and shower fridge table and chair with the huge bed on a mezzanine level There s a tv on each level ,1

 Valet parking should be cheaper hourly rates which then would create more business UK needs to adopt free valet parking and get away from the system what is deemed as luxurious and get with the times ,0
1 Bath room is not cleaned After room cleaning a lot of hair can be still found in the sink 2 Every Evening after whole day visit find the room card doesn t work Each time i have to go down to the reception for validation even i have paid all my stay 3 We live in the family room but they only give bathgel and shampoo for max 2 persons Every Evening i have to call for extra for rest of the family,0

I booked for 3 guest but only supplied a bottle of water and tea for 1 person When explaining this to the staff the manager was extremely rude and disrespectful immediately She would benefit from doing a customer service course as the treatment my friends and I received was one of the worst I have ever experienced I would never stay here again and I would not advise anyone else to stay here,0

Unlike the small hotels around this area this one is large and well organized The location is great which is only 3 munites walk from Earl s Court underground station which means it is in a quiet street but also is so easy to get food around The room is comparatively large considering the size of the hotel rooms in London It only takes about 40 munites going from Heathrow airport to the hotel and is very suitable for people with large suitcases and arrive in London not very early I will definitely prefer this hotel next time,1
 No proper light over bathroom mirror Bathroom open to room Nightclub feel to corridors Floor in foyer worn and didn t appear clean breakfast was set up there and with the black decor was not very inviting we took our breakfast out into the courtyard The breakfast buffet was okay but the cheese was in a container which had previously been used for a fish buffet a whiff of old seafood at breakfast The corridors walls were covered with a black fake fur ,0

 Cleaner did not change our sheet and duvet everyday but just made bed They also didn t clean the floor and changed the body gel when we run out of it ,0
Staff were exceptional I wish there were a higher rating Friendly and chatty while still being highly efficient and making sure our stay was perfect This hotel is an ideal spot for a trip to London we could walk a large majority of places we wanted to go but still very quiet and restful The kitchenette is a lively touch we didn t cook but it apenabled us to store snacks cereal etc And milk and water on the fridge Plenty of wardrobe and storage space Bathroom shower in particular was excellent Breakfast each morning was great and though there are a large number of peopl 14 floors highly organised and efficient Wifi was great easily able to stream Netflix etc And there was a big screen TV with many apps and all the premium channels,1

 The hotel was a total disgrace in all aspects my bag in the luggage cart was stolen right under their nose when I was checking in What s more disappointing is the hotel s response regarding the incident I had little to no help from them even after complaining about their poor service The hotel only helped call a cab but then abandoned us at a police station far away around midnight Before leaving the hotel told us that they will provide roundtrip service Even after requesting for pickup from hotel twice no one came to get us After the incident no employees or mangers reached out to us as if nothing occurred We had to insist managers to meet us when they did they were neither condolence with our loss nor try to help us in anyway They were utterly rude and did nothing but wasted our precious vacation time As guests of the hotel the hotel has responsibility to ensure our safety including our belongings Even if hotel can t replace my stuff at least could offer help in any way rather than being immature and heartless ,0

 Nothing It was all very good,0
Extra charge of 45 on leaving as they made a mistake when giving me price for room and breakfast a nice way to make extra money Noisy water pipes no ear plugs at hotel reception,0
 Room rather hot airless Window with obscured glass into internal courtyard didn t open aircon not very effective Only one set of shampoo soap etc ,0
 The room size and access wasn t the best small with steep steps but it didn t detract from the positives I would still stay again,0
We had a family of 4 with sofa bed and that s the worse bed I have ever slept on There is a huge gap in the thin mattress and I somehow got through the night by putting some towels to fill it up The checkin took a very long time and the room was not ready by the time Since they couldn t predict the time we decided to walk out for site seeing although we were tired after a long flight,0
 Friendly staff nice restaurant ,1
 Dressing gowns were tatty and too small Towels too looked a little tired Bed seemed hot due to plastic cover ,0
 Location and cleanliness of the hotel is very good with easy access to the transport system and attractions The food is excellent with lots of choice and breakfast especially ,1
Room quite small TV faced 90 degrees to the Bed so no possibility of watching it Wardrobe light would not go off Bathroom very noisy when other floors used their Needed better soundproofing in the bathroom Bedroom was fine,0

 The rooms were not as good as Advertised and are in need of refurbishment We changed to a slightly better room,0
 The aircon was terrible and there was no key to open the door Room was so hot and stuffy which effected our sleep ,0
 i like the staff in the lobby that set and the main door bell boy they are the best,1
 This is the second K K hotel I stayed at the other was in Barcelona It s a great boutique hotel The hotels are spotless staff is extremely friendly and this particular hotel has the most gorgeous back yard although it was a little too cold to sit outside You re in a good neighborhood not in the thick of it all which is nice for London Would definitely stay here again ,1

 I highly recommend this hotel Excellent value for money in central London The architecture and the decor is remarkable My room was spacious with a high ceiling and large bay windows And the bed was very comfortable In addition to that the customer service was superb from the waiters to the Hotel Manager And it was great to see the Receptionist Cohen who has the perfect combination of impeccable manners with friendly professionalism ,1
 Great room,1
The bathroom was too small I m small and struggled but my 6 2 partner found it far too cramped The staff gave an arriving guest the wrong key our room number so we had someone opening our door in the morning when when we were getting ready and didn t really appreciate that,0
 A lovely place to stay Very close to the metro and the Luxembourg gardens ,1
 Could not have asked for a better and a more comfortable stay in Paris In terms of location it doesn t get any better than this If you opt for a room with a view like we did then you get a view that is the envy of all Arc De Triomphe We did not opt for breakfast in the hotel since there are numerous patisseries and cafes around Despite arriving at the hotel way before our check in time the concierge accommodated us almost immediately The rooms are large by European standards very clean and airy i m talking about the rooms with a view Friendly and courteous staff added to our stay A special mention of Mr Farukh who floored us with his hospitality and generosity of ideas Thank you Splendid Etoile you truly made our stay Splendid ,1
 The hotel was very good in most respects and the staff tried to help as best they could Breakfast was very good and there was plenty of choice ,1
 The mattress was a little lumpy ,0
The double room is rather tight and there is no space for large luggage or movement in the room Rather disappointed no robes or slipper or shower cap Complimentary bottled water is given on 1st day but not on subsequent days as compared to other hotels that I have stayed,0
 comfortable rooms and fluffy towels and plenty of them good to have a bath after a long day,1

 A significant drawback was the sliding glass door of the bathroom which meant that anyone using it during the night woke everyone else up with the noise of the sliding door and the bathroom light lit up the rest of the studio very brightly A proper door would give much better privacy to everyone inside and outside the bathroom ,0
 small rooms with the inside ones having windows onto the atrium were strange overlooked by passage way on other side of the atrium and claustrophobic with curtains for privacy and no connection to daylight,0
 The hotel was lovely and staff really helpful,1
 this was the crowing glory to my birthday weekend ,1
 There was no fridge within the room we stayed in and the room was quite small Also we found the breakfast room way to small we felt we were sitting on top of each other whilst eating our breakfast temperature was far too hot ,0

 Relaxed atmosphere Clean Good location Volunteered to store luggage for the day,1
 Comfortable clean and quiet Staff were very friendly and helpful ,1
 Useless staff in Bar We had to ask five times if we could order drinks Each time they said they would take our order at our table The final time we insisted they took our order at the Bar but still no one made any effort to organise drinks It wasn t busy I have no idea why the four staff were unable to provide an adequate service It was bizarre ,0

I had read several bad reviews about overbooking and sending people to different hotel but I took a chance I had requested and early check in and we arrived very early 8am Upon arrival I was told that a representative had tried to call me to tell me their was a problem with the hot water in my room and they had no room for me I quickly went into defense mode and told them that I had read this bad review about them and couldn t believe it was happening to me Desk manager told clerk to call reservation and let them deal with it She called and told them I had read a bad review and they found a room for me but it wasn t ready They kept our luggage while we went to breakfast and said I was high priority to get in our room We returned about noon and it wasn t ready so we sat in the sitting room and waited and waited While waiting I heard various stories to incoming guests about the water and high priority to get in Different rooms were offered as was free breakfast to other guests I kept checking on room progress and was finally told that the guests had just checked out and we would once again be high priority to get in We did get in our room at check in time and we had a nice room Club room was what it was called It was in the basement but clean and nice We had a few drinks in fridge and basket of fruit Tea and hot chocolate Upon checkout Two of us left early and one remained I stopped at desk and said that one person remained and I wanted to make sure nothing was owed as it shouldn t have anything Assured we were paid up When last guest left they tried to charge her for breakfasts every morning She replied that she was told that all was paid and assured them we had not eaten breakfast We weren t charged The hotel made things right by my reservation but I am not sure i would stay again Most of the staff was very nice and helpful,0

 A big queue for breakfast but can t be helped Delicious food,0
 Nothing to dislike,0
 Super stylish hotel next to a lovely park Close enough to the city centre but far enough if you get me ,1
 The hotel has its own character and a long history Very cool vibe We got a round of free drinks as consolation to the construction work outside ,1
Check in was a little chaotic but provision of cold drinks was a welcoming touch When check in time is 2 o clock you expect your accomodation to be ready at two However a complimentary drink at the bar was readily given by the apologetic reception staff,0
 All staff was so helpful to make our stay a memorable one from organising a special birthday treat in the room for my daughter to personally taking us to the taxis every time we needed one The rooms beds were so comfortable with everything you need Hotel is right next to the theatre which with children is great after the evening show being able to walk back ,1
 Customer service was great The room was clean and ready for us when upon check in Myself and my family will always stay in this hotel as we feel that it s in a very nice area The kitchen area is a plus I highly recommend this hotel to family with small children ,1
 You re always my hotel of choice You re staff are incredible and recently you ve been giving me wonderful upgrades I always recommend you and when work ask me if I have a preference of accommodation you re my first pick I ve been staying with you for years so thank you,1
 Staff was great Good breakfast Good location ,1
 Not far from Covent Garden and the hotel looks amazing from the outside,1
Decor is extremely tired and dated Wallpaper peeling off walls windows did not open mould around window edges and in shower grouting antiquated bathroom and a standalone heater in the bedroom Dust around edges of carpet I m not sure how this is acceptable in a central London hotel which costs upwards of 110 per night Definitely will not be recommending this hotel to friends or re visiting myself although I can t praise the staff enough,0
 The staff were very friendly and professional Room was excellent Even got upgraded Great value for money,1
 The dining tables are too close together ,0
 NOT the room type we ordered and paid for Two very single mattress made up individually on a king size wooden bed base does not equal a double bed Room was nice but not in our opinion a deluxe ,0
We were disappointed that breakfast wasn t included in the price of the room as considering the price was almost 200 per night Also I was charged for 3 adults in the room when in fact there was only one adult and 2 children,0

 Very busy hotel Breakfast room crowded and noisy Inconsistent housekeeping in terms of towels left etc but this was remedied immediately ,0

Lovely hotel with extremely comfortable huge double bed We stayed in the split level room which we really liked If you have difficulty getting up stairs request if you can stay in a room all on one level The Oosterpark is beautiful the shops and restaurants are great with lots of variety to choose from You can get the Metro close by 8min walk or the Tram is a short walk away and runs from the station and you can get off within a 5 mins walk to the Hotel All in all a beautiful hotel with friendly staff shampoo and soap in the shower Tea and coffee facilities in your room and in a location that is more relaxing than the central Amsterdam We will be returning,1

The room is very very small The room was not cleaned daily So far from the stations tube and bus It s for sure not a 4 stars hotel as it s part of a residence building,0

 My over all experience was just a disappointment the room quality was less than satisfactory because the view was horrid and it was poorly lit the food was below average it took an hour and twenty minutes to bring up a pair of scissors the hotel was grossly over priced for nothing other than the name it carries extremely disappointed with my stay ,0
The hotel will not provide an early check in You have to walk for about 10 minutes to reach the tube,0
 The room photos on the website do not entirely correspond to reality because only newly renovated rooms are shown but we received an older room although very clan ,0
 Room was adequate breakfast was lovely lots of choice staff were friendly and chatty ,1
Room so small wasn t meant 2 b at this hotel Breakfast is a nightmare no organisation in dining room,0

 Good breakfast Comfortable beds ,1
 The bed was itself very uncomfortable and very noisy which really spoil tour trip The pillows were well used and lumpy The breakfast was not the best coffee and tea were not great tasting some breakfast items were Luke warm and queuing up to make toast ,0
Fortunately we are not big people other wise the bedroom would have been hopeless about 12incs around either side so my husband just managed it The receptionist suggested we mention this in future,0

 My stay there was fabulous and I don t have anything that I don t like ,0
 Reading lights over the bed should be individual Impossible for one person to read without lighting up the whole room Safe difficult to set and in strange position Hairdryer difficult to use because of position inside a wardrobe ,0
 My room on the fourth floor had only narrow windows at the top of the wall and those were partly blocked by the roof decorations so the room had a boxy closed in feeling ,0

 The location was just fab nice and quite and with just a short walk from the park and center Also I appreciated that the Internet access was for free and that it worked very well,1
The sofa bed was not that clean so I phoned the reception asking for cleaning the bed and the cleaning staff came but they were not nice I waited for the lift for around 15 mins 3 lifts are not enough,0
 Overall I d highly recommend this hotel especially for those coming into Waterloo with a young family Fab upgrade to a penthouse fantastic views and very kind and helpful front desk staff Children made very welcome ,1

 Beautiful old hotel good breakfast friendly staff ,1
 Las vistas,1
 It would have been great if there was a pool or even the option to use the pool in the park plaza just across the road I was disappointed that they no longer have an executive suite it is still mentioned on the website so I had kind of expected it with the room we booked The beds could have been more comfortable but maybe they are just a bit old ,0
 Really comfy bed room was lovely view rubbish but very quiet so we all slept well ,1

The location is fantastic Covent Garden literally around the corner right next door to the Lion King and Mumma Mia so slap bang in theatre land couldn t be better We went with a group of 18 to celebrate our daughter s 18th birthday From the initial booking until we left the hotel the staff could not have been more helpful We received several emails to confirm everything prior to our arrival and the reservations staff were very helpful in arranging all the necessary rooms for a complicated group The bar manager organised a private room for us to have drinks before we left for dinner we went to 100 Wardour Street which I would also recommend for dinner dancing club ideal for parties at no extra charge with a lovely waiter who looked after us perfectly The doormen were super helpful in ensuring we got all our 18 year olds into four taxis making everything run smoothly and stress free All in all One Aldwych is now our favourite London hotel and that is really down to the staff and location They also have a gluten free restaurant which is great for me and very unusual so no problems with gluten free options Thank you SO much for making our daughter s big day so lovely,1

 The rooms were extremely small and overpriced We asked to be moved from the first room as it was in the basement off the main corridor and what felt like a storage area Very disappointed for the price being charged The second room was an improvement however still very small ,0
 The rooms themselves were far below average Extremely small with almost no room to move ,0
Lack of extra pillows Our room smelt when we first went into it wasn t pleasant We waited 15 minutes for a lift and ended up taking the stairs Our room keys kept failing to let us in our room we must of had them re programmed 4 times When we returned to our room about 11pm there were children playing football in the lift area near the restaurant which I thought was really bad as no staff seemed to be stopping them I requested early book in but was not given this although they stored our bags for us which helped I wouldn t stop here again for money we paid,0
 Staff were really friendly and went above and beyond when they found out it was my partners birthday with complimentary wine and chocolates Breakfast was lovely with a wide selection to choose from I would definitely stay here again ,1

 Had a great time in London we were really close to transport if u want a boat trip on the Thames or an open bus trip The underground and train station are close too We did a lot of sightseeing on foot walking to see the sights and even enjoy the parks and open spaces The weather was glorious for our stay so having a walk in a shady tree lined area was good during the hottest part of the day After each busy day we didn t have far to go back to the hotel to get changed and ready for the evening Hopefully will visit again soon ,1

Room not cleaned on 2nd day Very long queue for breakfast,0

The room was pure value for money I booked a Double Deluxe room but nothing about the room was luxurious It was small poor decorated the bed was on wheels one of the lightbulbs on the ceiling was hanging out of the socket and the toilet roll holder was broken I expect much better than this for a room that costs more than 200 per night,0

breakfast times could start earlier Mon Friday to allow for the travel time to get in to the city centre for work Room upgrades are not promoted at the reception or when booking in by hotel staff Wi Fi speed extremely slow The bar prices need to be more in line with the high street prices to attract more guest 5 00 for a pint of Larger is a little extreme,0
 The water didn t drain well The desk staff were sour faced do they not enjoy their job ,0
 My self and my wife came to london for a weekend birthday celebration On arrival one of your staff members rudely asked us for our passports just because we look asian we were both born in the uk and explained this She then carried on asking us for our passports even after we told her we have british passports She then asked how long we have been in the country Very very rude discriminatory spoilt our weekend We have used holiday inn many times before but will never use it again we feel very strongly about this will be submitting a formal complaint online review REGARDS MR SURJ DHAMI ,0

At first glance it looks like a dream hotel But then when you go see the hotel renovated and under construction which was not mentioned to us in advance Importantly they did not hear the construction work but ideally they indicate the presence of this order Even the room itself looked like dreams a room with two floors first floor shower toilet living room and a small refrigerator upstairs bedroom But at night when you go to sleep it becomes a nightmare room The doors of the rooms slammed shut and all entry and exit from different sound intensity in our room There really bad in this hotel because of the noise of slamming doors In addition the room may flooring and also hear every footstep in the room above you and from you Clean room we had not exchanged towels for 3 days until we asked,0
 Location was awesome Breakfast was good The rooms are a little small but are much nicer than others I have been in in Paris Lovely lobby area,1
 The one time I did stay here and wasn t moved the room was large but with artificial lighting all around the perimeter On the ground floor right behind reception so could get noisy and also no power sockets to recharge any items Badly designed room Someone from the hotel needs to spend a night in the room to see the issues ,0
 The service was fantastic I was relocated to The grand Lancaster Gate around the corner due to some problems They were very helpful counting with a staff of young profesional people always with a smile on their faces The bed was very comfortable my room was kind of small but did not mind was good for me and for one weekend They welcome you with a fruit drink Breakfast was good enough For sure a hotel to come back and to recomend ,1

 Cleaning in detail can be better breakfast although good can have more options,0
The hotel is in a quiet location right in the heart of London so it is within easy walking distance of most of the places we wished to visit We didn t experience the usual problem of banging doors and loud voices that seems to be the norm these days in big hotels maybe because we were right at the end of a corridor maybe because the walls and floors are well soundproofed so we managed to have a good undisturbed night s sleep There was very little traffic noise either It was lovely to be able to go to the local theatres and walk back to the hotel afterwards The Novello is a about 10 minutes walk away I loved the idea of the little duck it made it feel more personal and now sits in my bathroom at home The room we had was a good size the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean A bath robe and slippers were provided as well as the usual toiletries,1

Not a bad experience but would suggest 2 armchairs in a double room would be handy instead of 1 especially if staying in room for a while and not wanting to lie on the bed this is really nit picking as room was very comfortable,0

 The hotel reserves the fee of your first night from your account but doesn t use that money when you pay for the room so you have an additional amount of money out of your account which isn t helpful when you want to use it for spending money You then have to wait for your bank to refund the money to use again so make sure your account has enough in it ,0

 It was bought as a present for my sister but even though I was promised the night before she could check in she was not allowed Ended up using nearly all her spends to pay for the room Her review follows The room service was wrong on the first night someone walked into our room and the fire alarm went off in the evening I slept eventually with the door barricaded with a small wooded contraption I cried once in the morning and once at night They are unbending in their rules and gave me a bottle of wine to apologise They admitted the information was wrong but the guy who spoke to me was in training I could not go out in the evening as could not afford it I had to stay in the hotel for the Friday and was able to spend what little money I had on the Saturday Oh and at breakfast I hope you don t get stuck in the little cupboard they have The deluxe double room had no charger next to the bed and the wardrobe is really for one person for one night When I had a shower I had to remember to move the toilet roll as it got soaked the night before Our anniversary was ruined apart from what we salvaged and this was all down to the hotel Very upset with their unbending policies They need to think about their customers ,0

The buffet breakfast was had evrything in hand was well catered for has nothing went empty even the orange juice was well topped as i was drinking faster than water I was also offered veg sausages which was a surprise very tasty When i checked abit on the 1st night at 1am staff were helpful in giving a short car park space to allow my sleeping kids out of the car into my room my buggy luggage were taken up to the room after a speedy check in service allowing me to then go find my booked car park at briannia Also prehand i was emailed the room might not be big enough for my kids allowing me to find a quick cheap upgrade to a bigger room my other questions were answered just as quickly I told the hotel it my 10th anniversery in my extra comments when booking so staff can congtraulate my wife when we checked in or maybe at later stage they did one better by leaving a nice surprise im hotel room with a nice bottle of wine some fancy luxury popcorn strawberry cream flav for her belgian choc for me Very nice But we dont dont drink alchol but i was well impressed with the thought effort put in the welcoming Top marks Also on the 1st moring when we were planning our day out on sat moring on our way we forgot about the fresh milk to give to my 2 year daughter but the lady bartender saved the day in helping getting us some warm milk With no charge Thanks,1

 Everything about this Hotel was excellent their is not a bad thing I could say the staff the room the location everything was excellent and best of all the price we paid was very value for money I cant wait to go back the next time we come to London we would pick this Hotel again ,1
We were in a studio adjacent to the atrium Whenever the elevators go up or down there s a loud clanging noise The bedroom is near the door right at the atrium It s not a continuous sound so earplugs were necessary On the second day when checking out I asked if one of the hotel staff would spend the night in our room 702 I believe so they could hear for themselves We got complimentary drinks because of our complaint but the first time we complained no action was taken With the extra topper mattress the bed was reasonably comfortable Beware of the metal leg of the sofabed when folded out,0
 The customer service was perfect Every member of staff was delightful and went out of their way to help ,1
 The service reception concierge room service maintenance housekeeping overall was good efficient and friendly Used room service three times The service and food was of a consistently good standard ,1

 food recommendations were brilliant,1
 What s not to like ,0
We couldn t check in with two attempts even at 2 45pm which meant because of our own other plans we did not get access to room until gone 9pm Although we had a complimentary upgrade we could not make full use of the facilities and enjoy this lovely hotel fully,0

we weren t advised of the renovations taking place at the time of booking the facade was covered by scaffolding and sheets which made the reception and rooms dark The rooms are very small and claustrophobic the rooms we were upgraded to on 2nd floor had flimsy paper blinds that failed to open and those that did provided an unpleasant view of the backyard of neighbouring flats and bins However the rooms we moved to in the basement 003 and 004 were much more spacious,0

 Hot sandwich from room service was cold Tiny room but this is typical for London especially a single room ,0
Generally it s a wonderful experience The hotel is within walking distance of Earl s court station very convenient location There re cafe bakery fast food supermarket very near to the hotel The staffs at the reception are polite and helpful especially a gentleman The room space is sufficient there s no problem to put two large suitcases The TV is new and major English TV programs are provided Mattress is comfortable it s glad to find water boiler in the room so I can make some tea Complimentary mint chocolate and drinking water are provided The cleanness is excellent no dirty spot is found Bath towels and amenities are changed everyday The surrounding area is safe to hang around during night It costs only around 100 pounds per night which is a good deal,1

 I didn t walk into the room and have the same wow factor that I had when I approached the hotel There was large circle of damp in the celling which was a little off putting The view was disgusting At night it was very noisy from the central air conditioning units ex tractor fans that ran centrally through the hotel which was our view We did ask for an upgrade but there were no rooms available We reminded ourselves that we wanted the hotel for the location and not the room ,0

 Arrived to find beautiful building in scaffolding Queues at reception and some guests being moved to other hotels Never did find out what the problem was but the chaos was not handled well by staff and there were sections taped off with no entry signs Had requested to check in one hour early but room not ready OK so they had a problem Won t hold that against them Asked to see room anyway as it was a very special occasion and I had upgraded to a so called club room Taken first to a tiny twin and was told the beds could be pushed together Asked for a proper double room and was eventually shown one but it was still absolutely tiny Frankly if I hadn t been on a time limit to get to the theatre I would have found somewhere else The bathroom as mentioned modern and clean was little more than a cupboard The room was VERY small and there was no natural light Windows were covered in permanent papery blinds to disguise outside bin store area We were told that it was one of the best rooms in the hotel but I don t see how it could be or how you could get smaller Just labelling the door Club Room is meaningless My basic beef is that I paid extra for what I considered was a very basic room Didn t have breakfast there After checkout manager emailed me to ask for feedback and assuring me he was there to help in any way he could I gave him feedback and two weeks later he hasn t replied Sadly would not stay again Booked it as was such a beautiful old building but what a disappointing experience ,0
 The sofa bed was hard and uncomfortable in the studio room I felt the breakfast should have been included in the price as it was quite a lot of money to pay ,0
 Staff were friendly and efficient Room was clean Nearby facilities were reasonable ,1

the breakfast is very basic and the area around the hotel is scary and dirty I was travelling with wife and 2 kids I was looking around us every second to make sure no one was following us The reception area is the same area as the breakfast which is something I have never seen before,0
 Very childfriendly and helpful staff The Children felt very welcome and said that people in London are much nicer than in Sweden ,1

 The hotel was lovely clean modern and comfortable Despite a problem with the water they moved us to their sister hotel which was only a stones throw away and gave us complimentary breakfast for the entire stay to say sorry We also had our rooms upgraded and following another misunderstanding with the room booking the staff could not do enough for us to make it right The customer service was superb During our stay our pregnant friend was really ill and the hotel manager Lizzie personally cared for her and the hotel driver escorted her to back and to to the nearest hospital The customer service here was first class and I would highly recommend it I can t thank them enough for how well they looked after us I would defo stay here again ,1
 Our room wasn t ready when we got there no problem we were there before check in time and were invited to wait in the lounge and have a complimentary drink On return to our room at the end of the day we found that we had been upgraded to a junior suite thank you very much Beautiful breakfast everything you could think of and lovely staff attending,1

 The service was excellent and staff very professional and very accommodating when we had to move hotels because of a burst boiler,1
 Cleaners woke up us too early in the morning breakfast wasn t worth the money and the food hall was too small so we had to wait in line for quite a while bathroom was awkwardly placed in between beds and room wasn t big enough for two people to walk around at once and there was no bin ,0
 Everyone was helpful and made you feel really relaxed The hotel rooms are very well equipped with everything you could asked for ,1

the change over of staff at the check in too many different faces over 3 days must of been greeted and welcomed by 8 different members of staff just at the reception desk that the rooms were not depicted on the site as they were when we arrived the room was stunning but would of liked to have seen that when booking,0
The evening receptionist Desmond on the night of the 8th to the 9th of December handled a situation very badly when his colleagues earlier on in the day had given us permission to use the lounge room until pick up by shuttle to the airport at 4am he came to inform us that we could not stay in the hotel unless we book a room He apologized after upsetting us but it was a bit too late,0
I ordered 2 burgers for d kids on Saturday as we were meeting my niece and boyfriend for dinner and d kids were hungry and wanted to eat straight away so I asked for 2 plain burgers with nothing only the bun I informed them they were fussy eaters and wanted nothing more I was asked would I like chips and I said I portion of chips I got the 2 burgers with just the bun with loads of salad and garnish on the side and one portion of chips and was charged over 41 pounds for this Included in that were two teas I think it was a ridiculous price to be charged for two burgers When I looked at the menu afterwards I guess they gave me the burger on the menu which was 14 50 each It says on the menu there was a kids menu and the waiters knew they were for kids I think it was a ridiculous price and we didn t eat anymore there after that To me it was a big disappointment,0
Nothing except the fact that room service is closing at 12am,0

There are a lot of migrants around the hotel sleeping in tents Because of the location you can t avoid to walk across these tents which is very scary together with your family One night we made a group of 4 adults at the nearest metro station to get to the hotel safely It is very crazy and it will be worse and worse,0
 For the penthouse suite the room was kinda small,0
 Friendly attentive efficient staff Close to Heathrow Express pubs and restaurants ,1
A nice hotel in a very convenient location Very clean People at reception and generally everyone I interacted with was super friendly and helpful which makes a difference I also appreciated the welcome plate of fruits as well as the handy phone that comes with the room Very convenient especially when your own phone is behaving weird in other countries All this made up for the price which I initally thought a bit too much and I still booked an offer that was supposed to be largely discounted 120 a night for a compact room If I paid the full amount I would think it is overpriced but I guess that s London in the summer,1
 Clean friendly and a high standard in the room Bed was very comfy food tasted great even the buffet breakfast ,1

The hotel is under construction which was never mentioned when I booked it or at any point until we arrived there We then wandered around empty half finished corridors looking for the temporary lobby The room was nice but the bathroom is a glass box inside the bedroom it s not in anyway private Showering or using the toilet feels aptly like you are performing in some kinky Amsterdam window there was also a nail sticking up at the entrance of the glass bathroom which I first discovered with my barefoot We woke up to the sound of scaffolding being hammered together and someone drilling concrete Hardly the relaxing break from noisey London that I believed I had booked The pictures are of a hotel looking over a park yet the room looked over an empty courtyard scattered with random bits of scaffolding and debris The first floor corridor smelled like they were having some serious blocked plumbing issue or perhaps another guest was very unwell Their 17 breakfast is really lazily thrown together with cheap products and entirely tasteless honestly not worth it get breakfast somewhere else instead We spent 100 in 3 days on uber because this hotel is over a mile from anything and the novelty of walking around pretty canals ends 20 minutes before this hotel even comes into view They will also take 50 deposit from you in advance for every day you are planning to stay This meant on arrival I suddenly had to pay a further 150 which caused a non sterling transaction charge on my card only to have the full amount refunded when we left minus the bank charges for this pointless but menditory transaction We made the best of it but I really wish they had been open about the current state of the place and I definitely would have stayed somewhere else,0

 Location for us was important Main public areas high standard and parking a bonus,1
 Fantastic location and great telephone response pre visit,1
 The place is designed by someone who thinks design is more important than comfort By the end of the trip I found the walk along the very long corridor to my room was almost painful The room was ridiculously dark It was a big room but with one small window For that reason alone I would never stay there again The air conditioning could not be turned low enough to make a difference Almost every night I was woken up because it was too hot to sleep even on top of the bed The staff did not say hello to me once and I was there for five nights The cost was extortionate given the pleasantness of the facility But it was then suggested to me that I had taken things out of the minibar which was untrue Not to be repeated ,0
No Positive,1
 Great location really close to Luxembourg garden ,1
 We had flood every time we showered as shower head too strong for limited space in Bath and ill fitting screen No biscuits or hot chocolate in room and only one flannel left for two of us Also only one chair to sit on and we are two ,0
 Room very quiet considering it was adjacent to the railway and a busy road My room was very comfortable and well equipped and it s very handy having a gym on site Very close to many London attractions and travel connections ,1
 overall appearance of the hotel requires a little attention love the original character shame its not used to a better advantage Bedding very poor and room very small even in the Club rooms Decor bland and dated ,0
 The bed just not very comfortable noise in the room at night from pipe work lifts and toilet extract which was off but you could still hear it running somewhere in the building,0
 Just everything I ve stayed at this hotel lots of times and never had a bad experience ,1
 The room while clean and updated was very small I know that is not unusual in London but we were disappointed at that price point It was difficult to get out of the bed on one side as it was almost to the wall and no room for luggage to be left out and open That s really our only complaint Hotel has an interesting history and was fine for our needs ,0
Bed in room 110 was appalling and needs replacement To compound this the staff were aware of the problem which means I was not the first to complain,0
 Comfortable room if a little small nice staff and great breakfast,1
 The bed was incredibly comfortable we stayed in a superior double room and when i woke up i forgot my partner was in the bed next to me as it was so big amazing ,1
 Some of staves talked to us in Japanese so we felt welcome ,1
Rooms were stunningly decorated and really spacious in the top of the building Pictures are of room 300 The true beauty of the building has been kept but modernised brilliantly Also the bath was lovely and big and inviting Great more for couples Restaurant menu was a bit pricey but there were loads of little eatery places nearby within walking distance and the tram stop into the centre was about a 6 minute walk away and only about 3 or 4 stops from the centre of Amsterdam Would recommend this hotel to anyone it s unbelievably well priced too,1

The hotel is in a great location with close proximity to Waterloo station It was very easy to get to the hotel from Heathrow Airport via the Heathrow Express and Bakerloo line from Paddington station The staff was very friendly and helpful For a hotel room in Europe the double suite was a good size for a family of four We also had a great view of the London Eye from the 5th floor The children loved their coloring packets and were excited to use their Park Plaza Euros at the bar I would highly recommend this hotel,1
 The breakfast is no longer exceptional It used to be a drawcard but is now quite ordinary ,0

 We really liked the breakfast There was a wide choice of food The hotel is in a nice neighbourhood with many good quality restaurants It is also close to the subway station ,1
 Nothing that I noted ,0
 Claustrofobic size of a room The fact that every time I wanted to use wi fi I needed to logg in extremely annoying The very thin duvet and lack of a spare blanket No signal on TV,0
 I liked the staff s hospitality And the room s decoration ,1
 The professionalism of the staff attentative but not too overbearing ,1
 Breakfast was pricey,0
 Modern rooms close to nearly tube station and a short walk to the London Eye Great location if you want to be close to tourist hot spots but dont want to stay in a super busy area Clean and suitable rooms ,1
Restaurant has no spaghetti no garlic bread etc etc we were in a group of 12 and there was several dishes unavailable the desert was tiny wouldn t use the restaurant again,0
 The room we stayed in was pretty small the decor very dated and it generally seemed a little shabby compared with the spectacular impression from outside ,0

Room was far too small window was so cold and drafty that we were all awake most of the night I ve never complained about a hotel before but it was awful The only place the cot would fit was in the window and the baby was genuinely freezing cold We had another young child so couldn t move rooms in the middle of the night Consequently we all had no sleep It really wasn t acceptable The room was too small really drafty and the curtains didn t actually meet so the youngest child was up at the crack of dawn too Really marred our holiday Hotel offered 50 back on the room but this really wasn t enough based on such a terrible night Such a shame because this place could be really great,0
We were told after our stay that our breakfast could ve been free if we d book directly through the hotel website We paid about 22 euros a morning for breakfast for 5 mornings,0
The hotel is amazingly designed The walls and curtains are fluffy What more could you want The staff were all really helpful and friendly We woke up without hot water and they immediately upgraded us to a bigger room However they noticed the hot water issue was covering the full hotel which unfortunately they couldn t get fixed immediately on a Saturday They offered all customers 30 of their booking back which was great,1
 Cooker breakfast was really great value ,1
 The room is extremly small and i found insects in the room and the reception ,0

 Amazing staff ,1
Just by chance I hit upon a hotel with a history It appears to be a small hotel with an amazing story The lower floors have wonderful wood panelling and scultured wood over the doors and stained glass leaded windows The breakfast rooms have beautiful moulded ceilings however my single bedroom was ultra modern Apparently Edward 7th bought this house for his mistress Lilly Langtry and had a small theatre and bar installed which are very ornate and intimate The hotel is in an excellent position being near Queensway Tube Station on the Bayswater Road and right opposite Kensington Gardens and about 6 minutes walk from the Palace It took me 45 minutes to walk through the Gardens and across Hyde Park passing the Serpentine and Rotten Row to reach Marble Arch,1

 The only thing missing was there was no bath only a shower but it was a great shower The rooms were a little too cosey small ,0
 Very little,0
 We liked how central the hotel was and the frienlyness of the staff,1
 Sofa bed had a metal bar that was very uncomfortable The shower only had hot water no matter how many attempts we made No pool ,0
 Basic rooms and pretentious top hatted concierge ,0
What they call a double bed could even fit 2 27 year old adults in Dent in middle of matress Fire alarm went off Both rooms we had were so cold and drafty The whole room was so small when going to the toilet you could hardly sit down The hotel it s self is lovely but the rooms are far to small and beds for what we paid I have never ever left a review but feel in this instance it is necessary,0
 We had an evening meal and the menu hadn t changed since our last visit ,0
 Long lines for breakfast,0
 Bed was too small and the property was loud This was the only property I used a debit card in and on return to the US someone in the UK area cloned my card and used it to withdraw cash Not recommended ,0
Our room was one of the top twin room paid 320 a night but no slippers no bath gowns no face cloth Very poor toiletries Bath tub handle was not clean and rusty water has been dripping And bath room was very cold Room has a one very cheap small table which wobble so badly with two armchairs Not impressed at all,0
 Is the worst possible location The hotel is in a run down area right next to a homeless shelter Not great at all when your girlfriend is frightened to walk from the hotel to the tube station ,0
 Cleanliness of the room and the fresh croissants ,1
I had booked online and was informed I could pay at the property The hotel debited my account on the Friday prior to my stay on the Sunday which I wasn t overly concerned with as I had no plans to cancel On checking in they asked for the balance of the room I explained that the money had already been debited from account and I was told that it was just to hold the room and I would need to pay again So in theory I have paid twice for the room I have been assured that the holding amount will be credited back to my account within 7 days But this not very good practice and would put me off booking an overnight break with this hotel again,0
Serving of coffee for breakfast had logistics problems Please give people a tip that they can ask for a pot to be filled with coffee to be able to serve themselves at acceptable frequencies Now for every cup we were dependent on staff not always available and not always 100 coffee focussed noticing our lack of java and distributing one cup at a time,0
 Loved the staff The concierges Serge V Dario Bernard and Max all of them wonderful And Lorenzo at the front desk I plan to post a physical letter to the hotel to cite all these people And like Arnold S I ll be back ,1
 Bed was very hard and bathroom would get pretty flooded from the shower but it was small so that might not be preventable ,0
 For an off season price was high,0
 Staff friendly and good value overall,1
 Very nice hotel with excellent friendly staff Comfortable rooms and beds Very nice breakfast and good food in general I will certainly use it again when in London despite the traffic noise Excellent value when booked through this website ,1

 As a smoker would like to see ash trays outside as a courtesy ,0
 The bathroom was amazing Though we were two friends sharing and it had a glass screen so it was a bit uncomfortable at times They should think about a screen or opaque glass ,0
 Bedrooms and the style of the hotel Staff are lovely and the hotel is comfortable Easy to find off Fleet Street and close to major sights,1
 Beautifully crafted historic structure elegant sitting room and bar Carved stairway leaded glass windows with window seats cocktail bar and high tea available a fresh bowl of apples at reception every day And bathtubs ,1
 There was a little construction at the time but we were compensated with a free drink and room well away from the work ,0
 Staff are well mannered and provide high standards of service Breakfast buffet is first rate Easy access to rest of London esp Old Brompton Road and Knotting Hill ,1
 The shower had limescale on the floor the bed was dirty initially and room furniture was a little tattered but was all rectified when I was moved rooms twice,0

Room was too hot even with air con as could only put down to 19 degrees,0
 On arrival we were upgraded from a superior room to a studio apartment which was excellent the bathroom was very nice with a lovely bath and fantastic shower The staff were very pleasant and the doorman was happy to stand out in the rain until he could hail us down a taxi The cocktails in the bar were very good particularly the pina colada We didn t manage to sample the breakfast but overall I was very happy with my choice of hotel,1

Staff was friendly but could be slightly more helpful when asking some directions for a good place to eat Missing a bar or place for a drink Limited shops and restaurants in the direct area unless you cross over to the High Street Champs drinks in the minibar are overpriced 6 for a simple coke but this is a more Paris issue in general perhaps,0

 We were going to the hyde Park British summer time festival so this hotel was in a good location and very close to tube station Staff were very polite and helpful On our first day we were up and out too early for breakfast so the hotel did provide us with a take away breakfast which was good enough and on the Sunday we had breakfast in the hotel it was lovely good variety ,1

I was charged 150 as pre auth on arrival and then next day I was charged the room rate of 99 so I have been charged 249 expecting only to be charged 99 which left me short during my stay This is unacceptable practice I have been advised that it will take 3 working days for the pre auth payment to be refunded which is a disgrace,0
 Sink in bathroom extremely small We were asked for our champagne to room and didnt appear so had to get on check out Also found it very disappointing to be asked to pay for room service on the spot and not able to put on room bill we were very offended by this we have stayed in hotels all over the world and never been asked to do this before In fact had returned from a wonderful holiday in Hong Kong just the week before and had room service and paid on check out Would appreciate some feed back on this matter,0

 Club sandwhich needs improvement,0
 old room old carpets old pillow and beds small tv old toilet small is ok but there are cracks in the tub,0
 The hotel gardens and patios were under major renovation The sidewalk entrance was a mess There was no mention of this at all on the booking com website We were given a voucher for one drink cocktails excluded as compensation Not good enough ,0
 Great location and such a beautiful interior The historic connection added to the glamour too Fabulous restaurants nearby and excellent transport links ,1
 Even everyone who travelled paris before said that hotel rooms are really small it wasn t that much Our room was more bigger than we thought The location is excellent near to RER b station Luxembourg also a transfer station like Odeon and Cluny Just walking distance to Pantheon Luxembourg gardens etc In addition near to a big market Monoprix ,1
 The only thing I d say that could have been slightly better was the friendliness of the hotel staff they were OK but maybe need a bit more chat to there customers Also as I am a genius booking com member I had free late check out but I wasn t able to find out whether I could have this or not until the morning we were leaving which left us a bit uncertain with our day plans ,0

 Restock tea and coffee facilities have proper cups for tea and coffee not paper cups have a separate desk for reception separate to shop and bar as there was always people at the desk buying things and not enough staff to attend to customers staff not very friendly no greetings unless you greet them first ironing facility only on one level should be available in every room Our pre arranged transport waited for us outside and we waited inside despite front desk knowing that there was transport waiting for for customers and us telling them we were waiting for transport to pick us up we had to go outside and asked the driver who had been waiting for us for a while when we noticed he was there Very poor service ,0
 Very courteous staff Good Indian cuisine on menu Clean updated compact rooms with very small but nicely appointed bathroom shower combo ,1
 Everything about this hotel is fabulous,1
 Breakfast was ok apart from the bacon which was terrible,0
Booked a superior room for two and had the confirmation for that At arrival they told us the room was not available and offered two single rooms instead We declined so we got what they call standard double The room was minuscule had no heating at all the window that went on an inner courtyard was completely condensed after half an hour we tried to warm up the room with the hairdryer In addition to that the curtain didn t go up at all The overall experience was absolute sub standard in compensation they offered after some discussion a complementary breakfast and a 20 discount I wouldn t come back here anyway and I wouldn t recommend this hotel to anybody From the outside it s really beautiful Once passed the doors it s another story,0
 The room was not clean The both tube cannot be used One of the twin bed was not comfortable ,1

The elevators are so slow and everyone is upset about it Every morning there is a long waiting line for breakfast very frustrating to wait about 20 min for a table,0
We booked a superior double expecting something double and superior our room 711 was just a bit bigger than a large cupboard my wife and I had to squeeze against the wall for one another to pass we are not heavy weights we were not informed that the hotel is under refurbishment at the time of booking therefore not expecting the facilities to be severely limited and certainly not expecting the breakfast to be served in the downstairs lounge where tables are closer than Macdonalds restaurant There were many people complaining and the atmosphere for staff was not good and despite this they were cheerful and trying to please guests,0
 Great location and property,1
 We got a free upgrade Very handy for London eye ,1

Lock on bedroom door was broken Exterior bedroom doors were filthy and everywhere looked like it was in need of a good clean redecoration and some tlc At checkin we were told we d been upgraded to a family suite The room was depressing and when we asked reception tif we could see the room we d booked we were advised that there weren t any available The upgrade was clearly a con We d have been much more understanding if we d been told the truth from the outset The family suite was a major disappointment dingy with dirty marked walls and carpet that looked grubby and threadbare around the edges Hotel was run down inside and not at all like the internet photos The bar was unfriendly and uninviting as was the furniture It lacked atmosphere and the carpet was filthy especially around the Windows The beds were comfortable but not sure why we had two single beds when we d requested a double When we mentioned the door lock to reception to be fair they removed my 5 00 beer tab from the bill My wife did not drink her unchilled glass of white wine and the rather surly barman reluctantly didn t charge for it which was appreciated No restaurant or room service We were very disappointed as nothing about this hotel felt or looked 4 Staff were pleasant enough,0

We booked the restaurant in evening and when we went to pay we asked if we could split the bill as we were with friends and we had our son so ours was more and we were told it would take to much time and he was to busy to do it and we would have to do it ourselves so we then had to go off to one side and get our phones out to work it out for him We paid a lot to stay there and brought another 2 couples with us and I just felt his attitude was not in keeping with a restaurant and hotel like that and I would think twice about dining there again Other than that the other staff were lovely and helpful especially the concierge who was so friendly and helpful,0

 Oh hotel is quite nice but sorry to say the location is terrible not acceptable Hotel should have a shuttle for guests to take them to the closest metro station to avoid walking through the intimidating neighbourhood especially with kids ,0
No Negative,0
 The room rate is too high compared to the services provided The room service could have been better I stained my sheets with coffee and makeup on my first night and when my room was cleaned the next morning the cleaners failed to change my sheets ,0
 Nice location,1
The room and facilities are very nice I really wanna stay in all day but yeah we re here to travel The location is good There s a bus stop right in front of the hotel but you may need to walk at least 10 minute if you come from any underground station nearby,1
 On the whole it was excellent,1
 Polite and friendly staff ,1
 Small bathroom but was enough for the stay ,0
 The location was good few minutes walk to Waterloo station The kitchenette was very useful microwave side space in the fridge and cutleries Room was a good size Separate sleeping area for the kids ,1
While it was a great idea to have guests decide whether or not to have room cleaned we would have had to give note stating this to reception by 9am I did not even read it until 10AM Why not let it be signed and left in the room or hung outside the door just a thought,0
 You could hear the traffic although the hotel is not located near a main road you can hear vehicles passing by ,0

 Reception and concierge staff were very welcoming and friendly The location can t be beat for tube nearby and Boris Bike stands There s a Pret a Manger for quick bites and breakfrast and Brunswick Square also has loads of shops ,1
The location was perfect very closed to Paddicton tube station and to the Heathrow express station 10 from the beautiful Hyde park The neighborhood was so beautiful and quiet The bed was also great and the room was big and very clean,1
 Service and location both excellent Hotel was a beautiful building we did not eat at hotel but bar and dining room looked very inviting We had an issue with the room and it was not possible to resolve it in time but we were offered and accepted a complimentary taxi to our train station ,1
 Fabulous bed and bathroom extra big great for getting ready for an occasion It was like a little oasis of quiet set away from all the noise Will stay again ,1

 The bar prices are astronomically high so we left the hotel and spent the evenings elsewhere ,0
 Very helpful staff at the front desk and our room was spacious and very comfortable,1
 The staff are very attentive extremely keen to ensure your stay is pleasant and enjoyable Their interest appears very genuine and without exception the staff are this hotels greatest asset location adjacent to Hyde park was lovely in the Autumn ,1
 The A C control in the room did not work We notified the issue the day we checked in but it was never fixed We needed to call the counter for them to change the room temperature The furnishings in the lobby need attention they look old and beat ,0
 I don t see how any improvements could be made to the quality of the room cleaning services and position of the hotel I would definitely return ,0
 Tea and coffee facilities should be in the room although you could phone reception and ask for them I feel they should have been there without asking the room could have been bigger,0
 Needs a smartening up of its appearance But then it s in Bayswater not Mayfair ,0
 Curtains did not close properly looked a bit worn ,0
 Great location very friendly and efficient staff I m coming back ,1

We got upgraded to a Club Room Lord knows what standard is like Room 222 almost behind a cupboard door next to a fire exit it looked like Room very small with the tiniest of windows which was frosted and when opened looked out onto a passageway full of air conditioning vents and old cars Bed has broken springs so every time one of you moves the other rides the wave Bathroom clean and shower ok but really poor value Bar closed at 11 and breakfast was a whopping 15 each we didn t have it,0
 Slightly slow internet ,0
 Amazing views staff very helpful fully equipped facilities from gym to bar so whether you are staying for business or pleasure all your needs are taken care of,1
 The beds very comfy but not enough room to move round kept hitting my toes on the bottom of the bed The staff were very helpful especially at breakfast as the big restaurant was closed and there was not enough room for everyone so we had to have our breakfast in the bar and it was not very warm overall we would go back again ,1
 Great location ,1
The room was a little small for a 4 star hotel and the price we paid and the bed was very uncomfortable and creaked every time you moved,0
 Modern very clean and very friendly hotel well located Food in the restaurant was excellent staff very attentive and nothing too much trouble readily adapted the menu for the children to suit Would definitely recommend and stay here again ,1

 Unable to see the city as rooms internal,0
 Beautifully designed hideaway in a great location,1
 The toilet flush did not work properly The sink could not be reached as it was so small Cold tap could not be opened without excessive force,0
 The ease of staying with children in a family room and the facilities that come with it Great value ,1
 The room was the smallest room i had ever seen It was a struggle to manage to clamber around the bed and not at all like the advertised photos The was a chair in the room pushed under the table but as the end of the bed was behind the chair it was not possible to pull the chair out to sit on It was then a hinderance makibg it more difficult to get around the other side of the bed ,0
 The rooms are small,0
 The bar and reception was very nice ,1
 I did request items from reception which didn t arrive ,0
 Great breakfast,1
 The general ambience was one of welcome and quietness and staff were very helpful ,1
 outside the hotel in neighbourhood there was too much mess poor housekeeping There were dozens of immigrants camps arround the hotel which is the main cause of mess in the surrounding area ,0
 The restaurant within the hotel had very slow service even when it wasn t particularly busy We had to ask the staff where the food was after waiting an hour When the food came it wasn t worth the wait ,0

 The staff was RUDE The air blew cool the first night but warm the second night The temperature outside was not low enough for heat When my wife called the front desk the gentleman was rude and condescending to her when she asked if the air conditioning was switched to heat or was there something wrong with our unit I didnt appreciate his attitude especially for the amount of money I paid The staff needs more training Don t plan to stay there again and definitely don t recommend this place,0

We had to pay full price for breakfast even though my wife just had 2 rounds of toast and a pot of tea,0
The room did not appear to share the classical feel of the hotel It felt far cheaper than the 235 I paid But the bathroom was excellent,0
 The croissants were just perfect My little daughter is a picky eater but she just loves it ,1
 A bit pricey,0

 The location was good,1

 Great location,1
We were able to hear our neighbours which was a bit offputting Also we could hear the restaurant noise as it was directly below us We didn t take advantage of the breakfast which we were glad of as the queue for breakfast was very long at 8 30 am,0
 Staffs are very nice and helpful Well located with buses in front of the hotel to go to oxford street,1
 Location of the hotel and the attitude response of the staff Simply marvelous ,1
 the rooms were tiny and cramped no shelf space in bathroom ,0
 The hotel was situated within walking distance of the London Eye and other attractions yet the rooms themselves were quiet with no traffic or associated street noise The view of the city was great The Italian restaurant had an affordable menu The apartment facilites were clean and adequate ,1
 I was told we were upgraded to a superior room and the room was the size of a shoe box,0
 Room was not cleaned correctly Wine Champagne glasses left dirty in the room the floors felt dirty and the shower drain was clogged From the day we arrived ,0
 Shower went hot and cold and noise from other rooms annoying I know its central London and the traffic noise doesn t bother me but someone throwing up in the next room that sounds like its right by your head is not so good ,0
 The breakfast was not how I expected it Also the breakfast staff on the restaurant was not as welcoming ,0

I found the staff super friendly and helpful front desk restaurant door men room staff dining room and kitchen staff they all took the trouble to talk and help that s impressive I love the history of the building it has retained its wonderful Victorian heritage don t change that I loved the dragon on the 2nd floor staircase so cool The wifi in my room and all around the hotel worked well It was located very close to the tube station,1

Room was very small and the wardrobe is only about 4 inches deep within a wall panel the bedside table below it made it very difficult to reach If only there for a night this would be acceptable but there was 2 of us for 4 nights This was described as a deluxe room and was told be reception staff that you need to book a club room to get anything bigger,0

 We had booked a superior double room but were given a twin with sofa bed when we asked about this we were told there were no double rooms we could have but to compensate were given free breakfast Our room was on the second floor and the night we stayed there was a wedding reception in the ground floor reception room directly below us which meant putting up with loud music well after midnight I was surprised not to have a mini bar in the room and there were no hangers to hang long articles of clothing presumably the height of the hanging rail was intended for wheel chair users I also found I kept banging my elbow on the handrail in the shower over the bath again an adaptation for disabled guests The shower head could not be angled to anything other than straight down which meant standing awkwardly so as not to get my hair wet no shower cap provided and it also did not stay at the height I required and needed constant raising We went for breakfast at probably the most popular time and had to wait for a table even though there were tables for two empty and next to each other which could have been pushed together to accommodate the three of us couples were taken from the queue behind us and seated whilst we had to wait for a larger table to empty when a table of six left theirs was seperated to make a four and a two So why couldn t two tables be pushed together for us earlier ,0

 Breakfast was good my daughter also really enjoyed it Room was clean ,1
 Liked the location and the style of hotel,1
The brochure in the room stated breakfast until noon However it finished at 11 so we missed out It cost a lot more to have breakfast included on the room rate so was not happy,1
 Air conditioning unit didn t work and it was a hot night on Saturday with quite thick duvets on the bed Also the bathroom was VERY compact Quite a tight squeeze to get to the sink and mirror ,0

Sadly I cannot say that the rooms are clean enough for me When we got in our room we immediately notice there s something wet and sticky like juice or something just next to our bed We called the front desk and they said they will send a cleaning lady to us We waited at least half an hour and no one showed up We had to go to the front desk and complain again When we got back later in the evening the juice has been removed but there s still some hair on the spot We were however no interest to complain anymore Also on the wall in the room on the curtain and in the bathroom there s a lot of stains which I had to ignore the whole time I didn t feel comfortable at all The staff at front desk are very friendly However I guess they pay really bad to their cleaning ladies First you will not be greeted by the cleaning staffs if you run into one at the hallway What more annoying is that I got woke up at 7 in the morning by the cleaning ladies because they closed the doors so loudly when they were cleaning other rooms And they didn t close it loudly just once but for at least on hour They kept open and close the door I was really annoyed I was in my holiday and I just wanted to have a good sleep at least The parking place was small but ok When we arrived the ticket machine was broken Someone told us we don t need a ticket to get in for now and we just have to inform the front desk when we check in We did so and paid for 2 days when we checked out When we drove out the ticket machine was broken again So we didn t actually have to plug in the ticket which we have paid with a lot of money Of course we should pay for it because we parked there but still I was not so happy because I have the feeling that I paid for nothing,0
 The bedrooms are tiny but saying that we weren t in the rooms a lot ,0
 No room in bathroom to put out the toiletries,0
 Reaching room by stairs cause the left can bot reach my level,0
 Room and bathroom very clean room quite spaciious for London comfortable king size bed in a quiet square away from the noise of traffic nice to have tea making facilities in room ,1
I was not very pleased with my stay with park plaza so i took time to respond on this rating i can probably say about 2 3 unlikely to return on this hotel All the while i thought i could experience 5 star experience it was not I was totally disappointed how dirty my room was in fact the cobwebs at the upper lampshade was still there if you look at the left side of the bedroom the carpet was very dirty the room was over decorated at its size very way off on all the 5 star hotels i been through for a 270 a night stay its very unsatisfactory and lastly the buffet was not even close to the top hotels nearby,0
 Nothing no faults at all ,0
 The bar area was small and lacked atmosphere ,0
 Bit far off from the tram metro Small room and steep staircase,0
Too hot everywhere Air conditioning system in the bedroom was difficult to manage tried to set it at 19 degrees but it seemed to jump back to 24,0
 Room was spacious and clean hotel was ideally located and food was great,1

 Nice comfy bed very luxurious bathroom,1
 The trainee receptionist was very professional on check out ,1
 The fold out couch had dirty used tissues in it and it was extremely uncomfortable The double bed was also very uncomfortable Overall just not worth the money ,0
 we didn t dislike anything ,0
Lovely decor friendly staff good location but it is about a 10 minute walk to a tube station Brilliant facilities large bath and walk in shower,1
 The building work outside our room was quite noisy which disrupted our mornings The rooms slightly too small,0
 Feather pillows great bathroom very quiet location for central London late check out at midday,1
 Location of the hotel and view were okay,1
 Amazing exterior,1
 Everything was brilliant,1
 Not much to complain about perhaps the price but then again given the position ,0
 Good size rooms ,1
 I hated the fact that there was no Lip on the shower the entire bathroom was wet after one of us had a shower never saw this in a hotel before The room was very small for a so called deluxe double The hair conditioner was never replaced ,0
 No closet in the room leakage from shower doors ,0
Renovation around the hotel sometimes can start at 08 30 am and woke you up There is nothing inside the minibar but they charge deposit of 150 euros for nothing in the room They dont have a luggage room instead they have lockers but for this they charge deposit of 10 from you,0
 Nearly everything about my stay,0

Front desk night manager charged my bill in dollars without permission He tried to net an extra 40 on my bill with the horrible exchange rate When I caught it he told me I must have authorized it at check in which I had not Completely unacceptable,0
Service from reception entered my room without announcing and knocked on my door at 11 15 at night and cost of breakfast,0
 The room is a little small and the decor is dated ,0
 Great location,1
 We were promised the same room we had We left for six days and when we came back they offered us a room off the lobby by the elevator There was no division between the double bed and the single bed I had to insist they give us another room The manager did not want to go out of her way even though I insisted I finally said I would write a letter She gave us a double and single on a higher floor ,0
 The plus point of this hotel is its location which is between two stations bays water and Queensway There are lots of eateries and we are spoiled for choice ,1
 Lovely hotel helpful staff and excellent location ,1
 Location view clean and big rooms,1
 Our room didn t have a sofa in but these two uncomfortable chairs and the stairs was too steep for the room Didn t feel safe going up and down the stairs but these are minor issues I would recommend the hotel to anyone ,0
 Disturbance at night due to other guest causing problems that required the police to be called to sort,0

 my only issue was at check in where the reception staff sought to take an imprint of my credit card using an old swipe machine Although this was procedure I objected to any swipe of my card I am happy to leave holding deposit for additional costs but refused The staff to be fair didn t argue I have stayed at sister hotel without problem ,0
 It was a bit noisy with busy road just outside,0
 I didn t like not knowing about scaffolding and non working fireplaces Also the printer was out of ink the entire time we were there and impeded our printing tickets etc ,0
 Breakfast was amazing,1
 Insufficient UK power points for a couple on business without requesting UK adaptors Breakfast reasonable choice but a number of items were cool instead of hot Gym could do with an update Room was a little too compact ,0

This room was not worth 200 night I believe that the Premier Inn adjacent to this hotel would have offered a more comfortable room with better bathroom facilities The amount of space around the bed offered little chance of decent movement around the room The wardrobe was inadequate in size to offer enough clothing storage space for 2 room guests The bathroom sliding glass door could only be fully closed using great force is liable to break should a strong young man use such force In this case it could result in that person sustaining injury I would suggest that you use this tiny room as a storeroom,0
 Room not well sound proofed Internet spamodic difficult ss business trip ,0
 Cancelled the buffett by the hotel but still keep the promotions in the room menu its bad experience Didnt match the service as five star ,0
This hotel was great value for money Only a few tram stops away from the city centre It was close enough for all the attractions of Amsterdam but far enough away that it was a quiet neighbourhood The zoo is literally a 10 minute walk away or one tram stop Very accessible The room was extremely nice and the bed was outstandingly comfy best nights sleep I ve ever had I would highly recommend this hotel,1

After paying to secure the reservation I was asked to pay for the room upon arrival the money has been taken out of my bank account twice was advised that it was a pre booking that the money should be refunded into my account in 3 days Not happy my account has gone overdrawn if the money hasn t been refunded by tomorrow then I will contact customer service and get them involved,0

 Restaurant is dual purpose Good menu in the evening and very professionally run by the staff Breakfast very ordinary I am afraid Food from the cooked options cold Toaster both of them are not user friendly especially when there are children using them Tried the option of ordering breakfast next day as per the options Eggs Benedictine were excellent as was the restaurant service ,0
 The room was very small The bathroom ridiculously tiny Images on website are not accurate at all ,1
 The bathrooms are tiny but do work in as much as the showers are good but unless your very small it s impossible to dry oneself other than in the bedroom There is a lack Of plug sockets in the bedrooms and the bar area is soulless ,0
When we arrived we mentioned it was our daughters 3rd bday and they upgraded us to the penthouse immediately just because and when we got to the room there was a birthday message on the window a card and balloons in the room it made our weekend this penthouse has the best views of London I have ever seen best room we ve ever stayed in by far Sadly our 3 year old got sick and we had to stay an extra night and the hotel were able to move us into another room straight away sadly she was sick on the covers and we asked for new sheets whilst apologising the staff were more than understanding and kind to us and we can t thank the hotel enough the staff were incomparable,1

 Well maintained hotel first visited when first opened a few years ago standard has been maintained,1
 This hotel is starting to look very grotty Carpets are stained and the cleanliness could be improved I have stayed for several years at Hotel Russel but having stayed in lots of other hotels it is definitely in need of some refurbishment Also the shower facilities are rubbish There is not even a shelf to place your bar of soap ,0

 Every time you enter the hotel you have to show your key to make sure you are a resident of the hotel but they need to fix their attitude while asking instead making you feel as you are a intruder want to enter the hotel In addition time of check out they staff didn t help in taking the luggage from the reception to the car they asked me to ask the driver and that it s not their job to do so this single incident made me think twice to come back to this hotel or not Other than that everything was good,0
 Staff is not as expected from such a great name of a hotel Lack of experience lack of knowledge and I strongly believe they need so much in training ,0
 Bed comfortable Safe hair drier and iron in room,1

The advertising pictures of the hotel make it look very nice but much different when you experience it yourself The Check in was delayed by about 15 minutes yet had to go up a second time asking about when will we be given the key to the room Very poor check in and unproffessional No sink in the room had to use water from the toilet sink to boil the water There is no toothpaste in the bathrooms to brush your teeth with The access to the internet on the tv is blocked Very dissapointed can find much better hotels for the same price,0
 Considering the reports and ratings that are celebrating the hotel we were slightly disappointed The furniture of the suite looked a little worn out and old fashioned You can hear the toilet flush from the adjactent floors in the bathroom All in all it doesn t feel very personal and private in the room Breakfast is terribly over priced a usual thing in a lot of hotels to be honest and not worth writing home about Would definetly choose another hotel in London next time ,0
 The room was absolutely beautiful ,1
 We noticed that the front door of the hotel lets in a lot of cold air you can even feel it in the bar Other than that this hotel is perfect ,0

Squeaky floors Difficult to go to the bathroom at night without waking my husband Also 4th floor our window didn t open to the outside,0
 We generally loved this hotel We d passed it and admired its statuesque grandeur when we d been in Bloomsbury before So we thought we d try staying there The location is excellent so close to a tube stop that even with baggage getting in from Heathrow was do able The hotel s Victorian style has been maintained so noticing the dragon sculpture on the staircase a twin to the one lost on the Titanic and other unique period features the staircase itself the chandelier etc was a delight every time we left our room The staff was very helpful ,1
bed was really comfortable and the 24 hour room service and staff were fantastic,1
 I didn t have an opportunity to sample this hotel as they had a mix up as they put it and sent us to another hotel The staff there were rude as they spoke in a foreign language whilst resolving the issue so I didn t know what was going on,0

 Staff were pleasant and friendly Comfortable rooms Very clean throughout On arrival we were told that there was an issue with the building and that we were being moved to a partner building which was fine The staff helped with our bags and escorted us to our new room The only thing I would say of the location is that it isn t very obvious that it s actually a hotel and there aren t any signs until you come up to the door ,1
We upgraded our room as we arrived early and it was only a small extra charge the room was amazing with a great view Staff were really helpful and the location is amazing It s only a 5 minute stroll to the London Eye so you re right in the middle on everything couldn t have asked for more,1

The room was too small and messy there was no cabinets to put our staff in except one tiny one and the rest were without keys to be able to open it The toilet was too small and there was a blockage in the bacenet and the water was not going down We ordered club sandwich the presentation of the sandwich was very bad as if I ordered it from a grocery and not from a famous hotel like intercontinental The taste was disgusting I swear I wanted to vomit after I ate the first bite Our stay in that hotel was like a night mare and instead of the staff helping us after all what we faced after a long journey they charged us for 591 instead of 561 for that night,0
 No shelf in shower for toiletries In middle of renovations,0

I m very pleased that we choose to stay at Intercontinental London park lane this time me and my sister loved every thing about it we were feeling most welcome everyday every moment I already rated the property 10 but what I really wanted to mention here is the concierge Micheal Petar and the others were so helpful too but those guys manage to find us bookings in no time in the most wanted places restaurants opera etc We felt so spoiled this time thanks to them I totally recommend this hotel the location is amazing to the breakfast buffet is almost similar to our Hotels in the Gulf very tasty with lots of choices not only an English breakfast like any other hotel We are totally booking in it again,1
Location of hotel is excellent Big spacious room Great value for money Lovely Christmas feeling decorations Only tiny negative I booked a room for 3 people and the room only had toiletries tea coffee cups for 2 people,1
 Cool room decorations were very gaudy,1
 Nice central location lovely view from our bedroom most staff were very welcoming and nice ,1
 No snack in the mini bar,0
The change of hotel story it repeated with every gusts so I have reviewed some of gust comments before and I faced the same If you booked a room for three adult which is queen bed and sofa beds you will stay in the basement which I will not recommend So the only room fit 3 adult is in the basement otherwise they move you up in room with extra bed for non adult The room pic dose not match the reality,0
 Really comfortable bed The staff especially the concierge are very friendly and knowledgeable about the local area The gym is excellent ,1
 This is a beautiful hotel with some amazing features and a superb bar ,1
They need to provide slippers The fridge needs to be bigger To give you an idea of its size it could only fit two 1 5 liter soda bottles,0
 The location was not the best close to a metro line but a bit of a strange area,0
No Negative,0

 As an old building it s a bit of a maze walking around the hallways,0
 Nothing at all ,0

 Breakfast very stressful experience,0
 Staff and location ,1
 People who poor of listing to problem and cant solve it regretsbly,0
Room was a shoe box So small couldn t use the dressing table as was up against the bed and was a struggle to open dresser drawer to get hairdryer Carpet wasn t the cleanest One key for room with 2 guests Bar closed at 11pm Main sitting area closed off for magic show you had to pay to go to,1
We were in room 545 quite a walk from the lift and on top floor,0
Room old fashioned tired and in need of bringing into 21 century Heating inefficient and noisy Cheap synthetic pillows,0
 Room was clean Staff were friendly and keen to help Nicely situated close to main attractions Breakfast was good with a range of foods to select from ,1
 very small room even with double bed ,0
 There is nothing I would criticise the hotel for ,0
No Negative,0
 We were in a lower ground floor room with a window looking out to steps that go up to street level which was fine but the steps area had some building materials pallets etc lying there which could have been moved out of view Shower was a bit small but fine to use ,0
 The hotel was beautiful It was very clean It was ideal in location The staff very friendly very helpful ,1
 location quite good next to two underground stations very nice to stroll through the park in the morning evening the staff is friendly the breakfast is quite nice and diverse but not included in your booking for its price you can find lots of options in the city ,1
 Bed was very comfy,1
Hotel looked clean but can safely say this is not a 4 star hotel,1
 Room was comfy,1

 Staff were friendly warm and efficient Beds super comfortable Proper hair dryer with no need to keep your finger on the trigger convenient location ,1
 The room was smaller than expected,0
 staff EXCELLENTbed VERY comfortable,1
 View from the room,1
The rooms have no windows and very much dislike the air conditioning The rooms are too hot and not comfortable which meant I didn t sleep until 3am You can hear the lifts all night and they are noisy and I m a light sleeper Also every time I ve been to the hotel my room is never ready much preferred the park plaza hotel across the road,0
 excellent staff clean quiet very good location,1
 Check in seemed unnecessarily fussy in terms of things that needed a signature I ve checked in to other hotels through bookings com before and hardly needed to sign anything on arrival Also although I didn t go in to the club room it didn t look anything special through the windows and certainly nothing worth upgrading your room to have access to I didn t see the point of it ,0
 paying at arrival cause when something goes wrong like there was no hot water next morning you cant just move somewhere else quickly ,0
 clean tidy good location,1
 Close to everything,1
 Comfortable room and a decent size for a single room Location excellent Very clean and had nice desk chair tea and coffee stuff small double bed was great Also liked the general ambience and the style of the hotel is lovely ,1
No Negative,0
Staff rather rude and dismissive on check in which was nt a great start after a long journey Check out was lengthy so opted to drop keys in the Express Box Bedroom layout was odd TV in front to dresser instead of a mirror That was on the inside of the wardrobe door which then had to be left open which wasnt ideal Room was SO hot air con had no effect and no window could be opened Bathroom door is frosted glass and faces the bed so no matter how comfortable you and your partner are is still really not good Little confusing as there are 2 Park Plazas next to each other Food Drink is dear but its London so Nothing close for a drink unless you walk to the Southbank which we did but everywhere closed around 9 30 so hotel has a captive audience as it were Overall a nice but pricey stay,0
 THE OVERALL LOOK OF THE HOTEL WAS A BIT NEGLECTED THE PICTURE ON THE WEB DID NOT REFLECT THE IMAGE THE STAFF TRIED TO HELP BUT SOME FEEL SHORT WHERE AS SOME WENT BEYOND SAY WHAT YOU MEAN DO AS YOU SAY ,0
 Breakfast a bit expensive,0
 Better towels and more milk and sugar available in the room,0
Warmer welcome would ve been better Appreciate 3 tired dirty but polite workmen walk in to reception may offend But think my money is as good as anyone elses Breakfast was poor especially grey bacon left in bains marie or combi too long Plaza opposite Westminster Bridge much better,0
 Room was a little cold,0
No Negative,0
 The location was superb and the staff friendly and helpful There are improvements currently underway but it had little impact We had a with no view and noise from the air conditioning but that was probably a reflection on the price we paid ,1
Very expensive upgrade but asked 3 times for the bed to be made which was eventually done late evening when we really trying to get to bed,0
 Easy access from Paddington to central london,1
 Loved the comfy bed Had a great night sleep The staff were very friendly ,1

 Helpfull staff Beautiful building ,1
 We couldn t buy the breakfast we had been told they are to busy to supply all guest with breakfast it is rediculouse The bed linen was stinked Rooms are very tiny and toilet bathroom are so small you can t dry yourself after the shower no room for it The four stars on the website of this hotel is fake it is hardly three stars by UK standards I will give it two stars ,0
 Very expensive breakfast for what it was,0
 Good location close to Paddington and Lancaster Gate stations Near to Hyde Park ,1
No Negative,0
 The bath tub wasn t completely clean that would be my only gripe ,0
 The shower was extremely difficult to operate ,0
 Good ,1
 I felt the bathroom could be a little cleaner Because the chrome in the bathroom was not polished up by that I mean just a wipe over with a micro fibre cloth it made me look closer and the bathroom shower cubicle especially taps ect could of been cleaner it was a shame that something so simple let it down for me ,0
 The matress and pillows were exceptionally good Best sleep in terms of comfort ever I would be grateful to know your suppliers as would like to replicate this comfort in my own home ,1
 Staff was very friendly and helpful From answering question how to get to from as finding answers to specific shopping questions Nice neighborhood quiet for a big city rooms with windows and daylight great shower comfortable sturdy beds not too soft separate closet and entree ,1
The rooms was not big enough for 2 or 3 persons We asked for 3 beds but did only get 1 bed and 1 crap sofa The WC dosen t have a proper door so there is no privacy,0
 Great position for us from St Pancras and also for the theatres restaurants etc Lovely lighting and staircase in the foyer,1
 Heater didn t work for most of our stay ,0
 Shower head a little unpredictable in terms of direction,0
 I have stayed at this hotel a few times now and can never find any major faults with it It has great connections on the tube however is in walking distance to your main shopping areas and sight seeing Staff are very friendly and go out of their way to ensure your stay is as you expect it to be The room was spacious and very comfy bed I will stay here again ,1
The hotel was luxurious with large comfortable beds and good pillows As it was away from the main tourist areas it was quiet at night so good for sleeping The breakfast was varied and very tasty with the hot breakfast made to order from the menu It was possible to walk into Covent Garden within 10 15 minutes which meant many attractions and restaurants were easily reachable An excellent base for a good week stay with interconnecting rooms for the family,1
 The bed was huge plenty of room but the mattress was extremely hard and slightly bowed Both my husband I had an uncomfortable nights sleep woke in the morning with aching backs which was a first for both of us ,0
 The bar pricing and the breakfast pricing seemed a little steep even for central London,0
 microwave oven in the room made it very convenient to reheat food making you save some money from eating in restaurants location was great very near the station and to the London Eye ,1
 Location ,1
 There are a lot of homeless people living under overhead bridges across from the hospital We mainly used uber to travel to places ,0
 Fairly newly renovated looks great but bathroom plumbing isn t The space is small and okay if you re travelling solo ,0

 FRiendly efficient staff Immaculate facilities with top quality linens etc The position of the hotel in relation to public transport ,1
 TV in bedroom not working and the hassle of requesting the balcony door to be opened ,0
 Very Very Nice stuff reasonable location near a small park near the British museum and the Underground Beautiful Lobby,1
 The size of the bathroom was abit cramped ,0
 Pillows were big but somewhat solid hard The pancakes at room service breakfast were hard around the edges ,0
 Great old building that s kept in good shape Immediate access to Hyde Park and a nearby London Underground station were both very nice The staff were busy but alert nice and efficient ,1
All the staff were fantastic courteous polite and extremely helpful They offered us complimentary breakfast and upgraded us to Club rooms then upgraded us again to larger rooms They went out of their way to ensure we had a pleasant stay for mum s 70th birthday The building is beautiful and full of character The location is great A stones throw from Kensington Gardens Palace and Hyde Park,1
 Nothing other than it didn t have an interesting view,0
 Room was pretty small for the three of us ,0
 Easy to get to and from Station Many and varied testaurants in vicinity,1
 N a We love this hotel ,0
 We loved the setup of our room we liked the separation of the bed from the rest of the room the meals were fantastic too very filling ,1
 Narrow hallways and staircases tiny elevator and you still have to go up and down a half flight of stairs This was okay for us but those with mobility issues or a lot of heavy luggage might have problems ,0
 The atmosphere staff and service ,1
 The room was amazing,1
House keeping came knocking on our bedroom door at 9am Sunday morning Before I woke up realised what was happening she was letting herself into the room I did get an apology from reception staff It wouldn t put me off staying there though,0
No Negative,0
For 200 a night thought the room was a bit basic Couldnt sit on the toilet without banging into the sink Thought the bed wasnt the best Squeaked every time you moved,0
 Fantastic location comfortable and good size room quiet despite being in the centre of London,1
 Work was being carried out which we weren t aware of the rooms were TINY very little space to get around the bed and the beds were small our feet hung over the edge despite having booked a deluxe room There was no decent public space to relax in either the theatre was freezing and the lobby was unappealing despite the lovely photos The cleanliness of the room was poor very dusty lots of marks on the walls and floor and the sheets had not been changed since the last guests The staff did try their best including moving rooms as the heater was making a noise in the first room but the move itself was very shambolic They did apologise and gave us complementary chocolates and wine but we shall not stay here again when there are lots of other lovely hotels in the same area for the same price ,0

 We didn t have cold water coming out of the taps in our room due to mixer taps passing wasn t worth complaining about as we only was there another day so just bought a couple of bottles of water to drink and brush our teeth with,0
 service of the breakfast team plates were not taken away had more eye to themselves entrance looked poor given the renovation of the other parts of the building ,0
 Super space and comfort,1
 The breakfast system is very over complicated and needs to be looked at It would save your staff a lot of time not having to try to explain how it works Our party of six chose things from the menu as advised but no one told us that if you didn t have the Continental breakfast you would be charged for coffee or tea even though the other breakfast was more expensive anyway It caused a bad atmosphere over breakfast which could have been avoided Make the menu easier and you will be saved the hassle of complaints from customers The food at breakfast was good and it s a shame to spoil the good ratings just for this ,0

 Noisy for some reason in the middle of the night you d hear the boiler sound which was extremely annoying since woke me up multiple nights One of the trainee staff came inside the room despite being told not to when they were searching for someone s bags It s nice that they help search Not when you are showering on the toilet ,0

Room had a few damaged bits here and there Very clean though the bed was big but I found it as firm as the sofa bed in our room Air con seemed to be low in the day and fast and very cold in the early hours The other main issue was the lifts In busy times we waited 15 minutes as we had a baby buggy with us I had 1 gripe as I m quite OCD and don t like reusing towels i didn t receive the extra towels I ordered from housekeeping twice once each day,0
 noisy room was not dark in the night,0

 Lovely hotel Great location and great price Lots of staff around all if whom were vert pleasant and helpful What s not to like,1
 All staff were friendly and helpful in all parts of the hotel We had to change our plans to eat out and switch to the hotel restaurant This was sorted with ease The hotel restaurant wasn t the most atmospheric but the food was lovely as was the service Room very well eqipped and comfortable scrambled eggs at breakfast were actually the texture of creamy scrambled eggs almost unheard of for hotel breakfasts Great location for south and central London,1

 Can t think of anything we didn t like ,0
Careful as the website images apart from exterior of the building look nothing like the actual hotel Artistic licence being very creative My junior suite was reminiscent of bad student accommodation Nothing 4 star about the 7th floor I complained if I hadn t they would have left me to it stripped me if 189 I was moved to the 5th floor because they knew exactly what I was talking about and they tried to charge me they saw the light when I shared my opinion of the hotel threatened to move hotel Don t do it there are plenty of hotels that are more comfortable lovely better value for money in central London Oh the wifi did not work,0
 Basically everything The style of the hotel is really great The breakfast is really good good quality food really really nice coffe order from the bar The wifi was good in my room and also throuout the hotel The location is near a metro station its easy to get to the center I loved this hotel honestly and i will stay here again for sure The staff cares that you have a good stay i really liked that Thumbs up from me ,1

We love everything about the Hotel George the location the facilities the staff and as this was our 4th stay in 5 years couldn t stay last year due to illness or it would have been 5 I think that speaks for itself,1

Despite 5 rooms being paid for IN FULL in advance with a company credit card the hotel were still worried about something what I don t know so they insisted the person named on the credit card to be present even though they had already been paid Ridiculous One of our travellers paid for breakfast then when she sat down for breakfast they told her she had not paid when she had We will NOT be using this hotel again,0

Travelling to London was stressful as I had never driven into London before however it was not as difficult as I had anticipated it was easy to pull up at the hotel and park temporarily it is unfortunate to know that the hotel does not have parking on site this was however this was mitigated by the hotel having valet service which was excellently efficient however left me out of pocket to the tune of 45 however this was still cheaper and less stressful than using public transport The hotel itself was beautiful the accommodation we had was tastefully decorated you could see a lot of thought and investment was put into it the bed was comfortable i m sad to say it was better than our own for a fantastic experience I would recommend the last floor 14th the views were fantastic from the balcony The staff were excellent you could tell they didn t just pluck anyone from the streets give them a 10 minute induction and let them loose they were very knowledgeable and eager to help without being intrusive I can t comment on their food as we didn t eat there there is plenty of restaurants around though can t rate them though as we only used one which was actually good The sites nearby were excellent which was the main reason for our trip The london Eye Parliarment Big Ben London Dungeons amongst others were all within a very short walking distance away others could easily be reached either by train or buses All in all I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone,1

 Hotel has clearly done a deal with golden tours bus tours we asked the concierge if he could recommend us a good bus tour he sold us tickets for the golden tours busses The tour was abysmal and not worth the time or money we spent on it Breakfast was poor just a buffet food was a bit cold luckily we hadn t had to pay for breakfast bc the hotel had made a mistake with our room so they gave us free breakfast in return but if we had paid I d have been complaining about the breakfast to the staff in charge ,0

 The price is more relative to the location than the hotel Although the location is ok in relation to getting places in the city relatively quickly we didn t feel the most comfortable walking between the metro station and the hotel as the surrounding area were very run down and did not feel particularly safe at times A small problem was also the fact that we chose a non smoking room on arrival but were given a smoking room This didn t turn out to be that much of a problem though as it did not smell or effect our effect the hotel really but it may not be the best for others ,0

I had a bad experience with this hotel During check in the woman in front desk told me that they have problem in water heating system and they cannot accommodate me in this hotel due to this reason and they booked other hotel for me I felt uncomfortable by this offer since the second hotel was far away around 2 miles and the hotel was full of guests and no one of them was talking about heating system So I decided to to turn the table against them so I request from woman in front desk to show me the room For testing the water heating system by my self Suddenly her supervisor came I forget to take her name and it became clear that they have overbooking in this hotel It clearly proven they try to handel this problem by laying to the guests During that an European guest came for check in and the process for check in goes smothly I start shotting to the hotel staff by saying this hotel treat guests beased on nationality What a shame So the decided to give my room which was non refundable but they give me a very bad room with bad location Later they change the room I will never book again in this hotel,0

 Breakfast was great good location and friendly staff ,1
 Tiny room uncomfortable bedding Pillows could have done with being replaced You could hear everything from the corridor and people stumbling into the adjoining rooms ,0
Staff were indifferent and sullen I was given the impression the guests there were an inconvenience I left two personal items behind after checking out and after ringing on 9 seperate occasions speaking to several staff members and emailing supposed head of housekeeping I got nowhere not once did anyone ring me back even after promising everytime they would and I never heard from them about my items Ever They also gave me a 20 year old folding cot bed with a 1 mattress to sleep on for 3 nights I Would have thought 1000 plus for 3 nights would have afforded me a bed Yes I complained and they relented eventually Although the location is fantasticly placed I would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone in fact stay well away,1

 cheat two times no available room but charge me and then change ,0
 The rooms were tiny This was a deal breaker I do not recall seeing sizes when I booked but I acknowledge they may have been listed at that time I know they are listed now because I looked it up If we could have pivoted and stayed somewhere else we would have but it was not practical From what I can see all the hotels in this area had similarly but slightly larger rooms The single induced claustrophobia We usually all meet in a room to discuss plans etc That was impossible in this hotel ,0
 There was a wedding on which made it a little noisy when sleeping despite asking for a room at the back so it was quiet ,0
We really enjoyed our stay at this lovely hotel with beautiful character From the outside of the building to the reception lobby area theatre lounge bar dining room which all reflected the timeless elegance of this 1800 s building which was once the residence of Lilly Langtry The staff were super friendly helpful The location was perfect for us being close to tube stations making getting around so easy Also being so close to Hyde Park Kensington Gardens was good too making a stroll in nice surrounding effortless Nearby to the hotel there s a great selection of restaurants offering avarious worldwide cuisines A Tesco Express a Sainbury s both being 2 minute walk away was handy too All in all a great stay in London with everything we needed at our fingertips feet We would stay here again,1

 Grand Royale is extremely tired and run down for a hotel charging these rates Decor was extremely shabby and facilities were of a poor standard We had to ask to switch rooms as the TV didn t even work and we were told it couldn t be fixed Walls were marked in corridor and our room and stains on the divan bed This hotel is in need of either a huge refurb or needs to drastically drop its rates ,0
Girls on reception weren t very friendly To request a late check out I had to call one hour before check out time 12 noon which was defeating the purpose of having an extra lye in as our flight wasn t until 9pm Even though the hotel wasn t fully booked was able to check via this website I couldn t book a late check out upon arrival,0
 The staff were very friendly and helpful and our room was amazing the bed was really big and so comfy ,1
 Warm welcome and recognition of my birthday room decorated and nice bottle of wine ,1

 Room was dirty Windows so dirty could not see out shower door leaked water and floor flooded Loud music played at night when in bed,0
 Neat and tidy,1
 the concierge services and the staff generally are extremely helpful and professional they were able to get us best seats it s a great place to bring teenagers and the viewnof the bridge from the room is magical ,1
Hotel undergoing the building of a new wing not that this caused us any issues except signs of building work meant reception was a temporary pop up affair Rooms that we had were tired and in need of some love First room had a broken window mechanism and signs of damp with chunks of plaster missing around the window area Shower did not drain properly and overflowed after only a couple of minutes We requested another room which we duly transferred too which was better although bathroom lights would work for no longer than 5 minutes before they went out guess a problem with a transformer overloading Fault reported but not rectified during our stay The building is magnificent the rooms we had just needed some care and attention and then the hotel would be first rate,0
 Staff was friendly the hotel was clean and the breakfast really good ,1

 It was as I expected No complaints,0
I was completely disappointed and mad since the reception staff are generally unfriendly More specifically Brad Brad not only he talks to guests with an attitude and from an upper position he always thinks he is right Without notification to me or alignment with me he deducted the whole amount of the stay from my credit card instead of preauthorization He claimed that this is the hotel policy to deduct the whole amount if the stay is more than 7 nights I told him I was not aware of such policy and asked him to show me where it is written He said it is not written anywhere and the hotel is not supposed to show the guests all the policies I told him I disagree especially if it is related to terms and payments I asked to speak to his manager he said I am the manager Then I asked to speak to his superior Then he said I will cancel the sales and preauthoriz again the amount I told him this will not work as it will take at least 5 days to reverse the payment He said that he is sure it will take few hours Unfortunately he cancelled it and took 5 working days During this period the amount he deducted was stuck between banks and the hotel keeps trying to preauthoriz the amount and notifications from my bank keeps coming to my phone with failed attempted Of course those attempts hurt my credit records with the bank I was devastated and angry but no one said sorry and no compensation were provided to me Horrible customer experience,1
A bit worn out single Windows our room was on 2nd floor on pub street side and some noice was coming Rooms on 2nd facing inside yard had a really awful view,0
 I booked a deluxe double room there was nothing deluxe about it The room was tiny Literally the smallest box room I have ever stayed in The bathroom towels were dirty and we had to request new ones be provided The shower curtain did nothing to prevent the water covering the entire bathroom floor Which meant there was nowhere to then stand at the sink without getting wet There were no plugs near mirrors which made getting ready difficult I resorted to using the TV to see my reflection as I blow dryed my hair The room quickly got condensation due to it being so small however no windows could be opened Altogether an awful experience and I will not be staying there again The pictures were completely disieving and the cost was ridiculous based on what we actually got Very very disappointing ,0
The room size was ridiculously small it was actually a free upgrade so i would not want to our original 150pn room I literally have bruises from banging into things,0
Crowded reception and queues Room 109 room is next to something that makes noise during night which sounds like patio being opened Appalling breakfast grumpy staff queues and restaurant crammed tables too close to each other not big enough for restaurant,0
 I liked the cleanliness of the rooms and the hotel in general ,1
 The air conditioning in are room didn t work so well so it got really warm didn t feel the need to complain as we loved staying a spa would of been nice in the hotel also,0

Very helpful staff Room spacious with 2 young children Breakfast and room service food excellent Located close to London Eye,1
The room was below expectations Although we had a superior king room which should normally have a view it overlooked the back street When we asked the staff to give us a new room the response was that the hotel was too full Having booked a month earlier i dont believe they didnt give us a view room either bc of our late arrival or bc we booked through booking com For this price there are many other hotels which can provide better accomadations within the vicinity It was a definete disappointment on our part My advice is either pay a bit more and prefer 4 seasons or pay a bit less and stay at the hilton They re all 100meters away from each other Having stayed in all of those this was the worst vfm,0
My husband was accused of smoking in room he hadnt thy put a letter under our door and took 200 out of my account without permission 4 conversations later they reumbersed monies but it ruined it for me as i was very upset about it They made us feel like criminals and didnt give us a chance to defend ourselves our friend who we met whilst in London is a barrister and was appalled when we told him,0

 The room was spacious The decor of the hotel outside the room was lovely particularly the carved staircase The bed was lovely and comfy ,1
 Very nice locale Well equipped comfortable but not spacious fitness center Very convenient to Waterloo station which connects to central London well Went for larger room which had nice sitting area and worth the extra price ,1
Air conditioning wasn t great Where the hairdryer was situated in our room was convenient for the mirror You had to perch at the top of the bed to dry your hair as you couldn t detach the hairdryer to move it to a more convenient plug The mirror pulled out an angle to the bed The mattress was 2 smaller ones pushed together and this meant there was more bed stead than mattress and you found yourself walking into the sides of the bed all the time The shower door only opened half way which meant you had to manoeuvre between that and the towel rail on the right hand side which didn t leave much room Whilst the style of the room was very nice the dark wood was very dark Didn t like the fact I had to hand over photo ID and the Receptionist was unable to answer why when I asked only that it was hotel policy which is fine but why She took my credit card to confirm I was the one that made the booking my partner wasn t asked to show any ID and what if I didn t have ID would I not be allowed to check in despite me having pre paid the room Not happy about this information being available hence why I requested the copy back on departure Small Bar facilities at the hotel with very limited choice of draught beverages,0

 Rooms are quiet Beds are huge Bathroom is spacious and shower is hot and powerful Location is very good Thames within walking distance Temple area is beautiful Note however that during weekends the atmosphere is different than during week days due to the fact that many shops most of the business centres and the criminal courts are closed which results in less people in the neighbourhoud ,1
Foyer was a mess Only place to relax was the bar and that was not comfortable enough to stay for more than a drink or two We had a very cold spell and it was draughty The first room whilst ok for a honey moon couple was totally unacceptable for any one over 30 or afraid of hights The second room was huge cold and paint in need of repair The hotel states it is four star but is not It feels like a up graded backpackers It is basic clean no frills or comfort three star max I thought I was booking a comfortable picturesque hotel it felt like and old school building we later found out that is exactly what it it was The hotel was under going major re constructions to the foyer entrance area nothing was mentioned at time of booking It was very disappointing and embarrassing as I had also made the booking for our friends who we were travelling with Very expensive hotel with nothing to make up for the expensive rooms,0
 The hotel was conveniently close to Hyde Park where we liked to walk It was close to two tube stations bus route and taxi services A convenience store was close by The hotel is a lovely old London town house style and the reception hall and public areas I would describe as Baronial The staff were attentive and polite and the lady on duty at reception was particularly thoughtful and kindly Our room was very clean and tidy though rather small for two people that said we were quite comfortable ,1

 Convenient location Friendly staff We were transferred to another room and offered complimentary breakfast due to some problems with hot water in the room we originally booked ,1
The sound proofing of the room is terrible and you could here everything outside the door and in other room The layout of the room is very strange with the bed just beside the door and living room at the end of the room The location of the hotel is ok it looks very close to the underground but actually need to walk 10min from the station Not impressed with the service of the staff either,0
 The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable Quiet but close to all our needs Room was affordable luxury Highly recommend ,1
The room was nice and clean and fully equipped with the essential equipment needed while traveling e g ironing microwave hair dryer etc The hotel is close to London Eye Big Bin 5 10 minutes walking and around 15 25 minutes away from Hyde park and Oxford Street where all the well known shopping shops are Breakfast was fine and the food is delicious,1
 Small room,0
Our check in was delayed 3times as the room wasn t ready the room was small and incredibly bad value for money we have stayed in many London hotels and this is by far the worst the bar was cold due to being located by the front door breakfast was farcical after queuing to get a table on the first day we had no plates out only some cold Sausages available with uncooked tomatoes and warm beans the staff seemed very disinterested in general The friends we were staying with complained and we got the grand compensation of 4 bottles of water from our mini bar reduced from our bill This experience also makes me question the value of using booking com as for over 300 per night we could have booked direct with other far better hotels,0
 The dining room was a little cold at the door end That didn t affect us as we were seated right by the servery but could have been uncomfortable for those at that end ,0

 We were greeted so warmly and treated like old friends by the chef upon our late arrival to the restaurant the first night He was an outstanding ambassador for the hotel and made us feel very welcome and special ,1

I loved the atmosphere in the Grand R Hotel historic deco and reception incredible charming I also really liked the fact that the staff changed my room straight away when I didn t like 108 view straight into concrete wall and gave me a nice room top floor 705 This room was cosy and warm with view of roof tops The porter was extremely helpful and nice too,1
House keeping needs glasses Sometimes 5 shampoos next day 5 body lotion Used coffee cup not replaced Could be cleaner,0
 When i first got there i had room with broken a c but when i called the reception they changed it for me right away,0
 A haven of peace in hectic London A great hotel which I have visited twice now and which I have promoted to my standard London hotel ,1
 Continental breakfast was fine but an omelette was not convincing much too dry,0
 Nice staff good rooms with separate little living room and bedroom did not experience any problems with the reconstruction ,1
 The staff are completely unprofessional no customer service experience what so ever I called in before to confirm my staying and the lady that answer my call has no experience on how to answer my question and no telecommunication skills Awful ,0
 bed lovely and comfy breakfast really good staff reception bar waiter all really great ,1
 We booked as it was stated that they had parking available which they didn t When we got to the property they had no twin rooms despite this being what we booked ,0
 The location is excellent midway between the west end and St Paul s The hotel is in one of the inns of court so has a pleasant quiet isolation but within a few paces you are onto Fleet St and the hustle and bustle of the City of London Staff are very welcoming we were able to upgrade our room without any fuss and the whole team were very helpful ,1

Price is bit high for the size of the room per say BUT considering its located in only 10 minutes from Oxford Street and its right next to Hyde park its quite nice pricing They should have resupplied water on the second day as well No fridge available in the room No slippers provided Breakfast had to be booked and paid separately and rather pricey for a regular hotel buffet and does not offer an omelet they do offer fried eggs Breakfast was bit salty but that is just typical English style and it is rather subjective matter,0
 Good restaurant with modern design great chill out place Great park nearby the hotel and awesome main stairs ,1
 The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom very clean the location was great for getting everywhere ,1
We were upgraded which was lovely but the heating didn t work and the room was cleaned once in 3 days We had to ask for more towels We ordered two burgers which were disgusting and the meat smelled bad after 3 mouthfuls my friend was sick,0

Reception staff very poor service not friendly not helpful I feel we got fooled with a few things only because the staff in the reception didn t inform us about things like if you prebook your breakfast at the reception the day before is only 9 not more as we got charged when we went down in the restaurant if you ask them to call you a cab they call you a private kind of a chauffeur service which is more expensive then the usual London cabs etc We booked a room for 3 people in a small room there was a double bed and a very uncomfortable sofa one of us had to sleep on that on the sofa Also had a few issues with the charges on my credit card in the hotel they were not helpful they didn t give me any explanation they gave me an email to email them I wouldn t trust them again with my credit card,0

 The only thing for us was the location as we are not familiar with London We found it quite difficult to find Other than that we couldn t have asked for anything better ,0
The bathrooms are more like a cubical with transparent glass Not ideal if you re a fan of your own privacy Considerable renovation works were ongoing during our stay for the inconvenience we were offered a free drink at the bar I thought this was a nice gesture until I was repeatedly told I can have that drink or that one only a tea coffee or 25cl beer You might have well not bothered Hotel Arena It was more like an insult,0
Although the staff were nice they screwed our meal orders up twice Our room was really nice the first night large room with a window We decided to come back and stay a second night but got put in a terrible room Very small the air conditioning didn t work so we had to open all the windows in the middle of winter to keep it cool There was a bank of about 50 air conditioning units right outside our window so it was super noisy The bathroom stunk of mold and Lynx deodorant The drains were blocked and the bed was terrible It was super hard and super creaky which woke us up a lot in the night Between the creaky bed and the air conditioning units outside the stuffy heat and the mouldy stench we didn t have a very good sleep at all I think maybe we stayed in an upgraded room the first night without knowing An upgrade was offered to us the second night for 20 pounds but we didn t think we needed it and assumed we d have a similar room as the previous night But we definitely didnt On a different topic the adult movie channel was terrible Super fetishy chin strap ons surgical instruments lots of pvc and horrible badly lit ugly people having gross sex Not my cup tea but if you re into that kind of stuff you ll love this place,0

 Beautiful setting in a lovely park room very spacious clean and comfortable bar area looking over the park was stunning located on the peaceful outskirts of the city but very easy to travel around on the tram system old building with a modern refurbishment it suited us perfectly,1
When we arrived for a late night check in we were told that we were being moved to one of its sister hotels 15 minutes away The boiler had broken in the hotel They did not call us in advance and advise us of this problem They also had us sign a paper committing us to full 4 night reservation prior to disclosing the facility s maintenance issues and being required to move We were then transported at 11 p m to the other hotel where we were told we had to pay for the full 4 night stay without inspection of the room or area At that hour we had no choice but to make the payment We were then stuck in a basement apartment and all of the attractions we planned to visit were a 20 minute rail ride away We asked to be moved to a higher level family room and they were unable to support the request We called booking com to express our concern but were only told that we were committed to the reservation and had to stay at one of these two hotels We then agreed to be moved back to original one with the preferred location Around 1 p m the next day we were moved back to the original hotel Although I was told by the hotel s management that the room was located on the 2nd level and was lovely and would comfortably hold a couple with an 11 year old child the room was tiny Much much smaller than most small European rooms Worse yet it was filthy dirty The carpet walls windowsills and pullout couch were obviously soiled The courtyard area where the room looked out on was filthy also with garbage laying outside We have pictures to support this description It was shocking that we were not released from the reservation We have used booking com in the past but NEVER AGAIN They should have helped us to find an appropriate hotel even if it cost us an additional investment,0

My boyfriend and I had a great stay I arranged the trip to celebrate his 30th birthday When we arrived the staff on reception were very welcoming and we were told we had been upgraded for free The room was immaculately cleaned and all the facilities bathroom kitchenette television lighting were great We spent most of our time out of the room and exploring London but if we had wanted to spend more time relaxing in the room then it would have been extremely comfortable to do so The location was great a very short walk from the London eye and other attractions it took us about 3 minutes to get there from the hotel and close to Waterloo station which was ideal for our arrival to and departure from London I would highly recommend this hotel and we would definitely stay there again on return trips to London,1
The room had a fridge which is so handy with a nice bottle of cold water waiting for me when I arrived Also a plate of fruit was delivered to my room before I had even got there Left luggage was also available which is so handy There is a free mobile phone in the room where you can browse the internet and make free calls from I think its called IHandy Staff were courteous and helpful Great location 10 min walk to Paddington Station and about half an hour to Oxford St Will be using this hotel again Customer satisfaction stands out as a priority in this hotel,1

 Upgrade of room,1
 Checking the fridge for food and drink left behind would have been good A little more milk in the room would have been nice We weren t really there longer enough to request more ,0
 My room was dirty and I was afraid to walk barefoot on the floor which looked as if it was not cleaned in weeks White furniture which looked nice in pictures was dirty too and the door looked like it was attacked by an angry dog My shower drain was clogged and the staff did not respond to my request to clean it On a day with heavy rainfall a pretty common occurrence in Amsterdam the roof in my room was leaking luckily not on the bed you could also see signs of earlier water damage I also saw insects running on the floor Overall the second floor of the property looked dirty and badly kept On top of all of this a repairman who came to fix something in a room next door at midnight was very noisy as were many of the guests I understand the challenges of running a hotel in an old building but this negligence is inconsistent with prices demanded by the hotel On the last night after I complained about water damage the night shift manager offered to move me to a different room but that offer came pretty late around midnight when I was already in bed and ready to sleep ,0

the room is too small we booked a deluxe twin the reality was different from the photos there was hardly any room for suitcases the bed sheets were dirty such basic necessities as toiletries and toilet paper were often missing when we came back to the hotel in the evening the shower hose was too short and my height is only 1 6 m so if you are tall it ll be very uncomfortable you can hear the floors creaking and squeaking from all the rooms around and above,0

We booked a Superior Double room for my mum and I wouldnt have described it as superior but it was a beautiful room bed was comfy bathroom was spotless and old building itself was just stunning Breakfast was superb and well worth 12 prebooked a selection of hot food including boiled eggs pastries and toast fresh fruit yoghurt salmon cheese and ham Location is just around the corner from Queensway situated on the Central line tube station which had a lift great for luggage,1
 There was insufficient hanging space for clothes There could have been larger cups for tea and coffee making facilities or even a teapot The room was fairly small but perfectly adequate for a couple exploring London ,0
 We loved the look and feel of this historic building its in a great location with lots of choice of restaurants The staff were very friendly and as it was my Birthday whilst visiting they kindly put a bottle of wine Balloon cake and box of chocolate in room to make the stay even more enjoyable,1

 Beautiful room that was ready early with the most comfortable massive bed Backs straight onto the park can t wait to come back when all of the construction is complete We didn t hear anything building work related whilst staying Loved the atmosphere and feeling of all the areas of the hotel Especially the hall to our room ,1
The room was great for a solo traveller however space and wardrobe would have been a challenge for 2 of us especially if you needed to hang formal clothes The rainhead shower was awesome and the hand held option good If I had a full head of hair maybe a challenge if not wishing to wash it The UNenclosed shower great if you do not need to use the toilet or brush your teeth after in socks as the floor gets wet Again if 2 sharing would need back up of floor mats slippers etc,0
 In the closet was dust I had to clean hangers at first and then put my things,0

 Food in the restaurant was good and the size of the room was excellent ,1
 The beds and decor were nice It was an easy walk from the tube station and there were plenty of food establishments still open around it late at night We chose this hotel because three adults could stay in the one room in three separate beds which is a rare thing to find in accommodation Extra pillows and a toothbrush set were brought promptly on request ,1
 I am pretty sure when I booked it was suggested that breakfast was included but this wasn t the case Parking information on area wasn t great Although we did find a great deal after some searching other sites online ,0

We have 3 persons when I booking on this website they described this suite have two bedrooms but in fact only use transparent curtain to separate bed and lounge where put small sofa bed it is totally wrong info from booking com so we have to take one more suite when we checking in the outside of the hotel is terrible dirty and not safe feeling but near to airport and exhibition it is good for me,0
We would have liked to know in advance that the hotel is being renovated We had a room right in front of the building site and were waken up at 6 30 because of the noise Booking com should warn travellers for this so they can ask for a room on the quiet side of the hotel,0

 Concierge Bernard particularly helpful Wonderful location,1
 Great location near the place de la Sorbonne and very pleasant staff ,1
 A little pricey ,0
The room was a Club It was ridiculously small in that it was a struggle to walk round the end of the bed Anyone more than 6ft 3 tall would be struggling with the low ceiling height The bathroom was a toilet basin with a shower which had a curtain ridiculously small it is not a wet room The mattress dipped in the middle so an uncomfortable 2 nights sleep Overall we felt that we had been charged a lot more than it was worth As a regular genius booker with booking com we ware disappointed not to have been alerted to these problems as we would have stayed elsewhere,0
The air condition is very good Clean and tidy room The staff are friendly and helpful Lots of Italian restaurants around and I found 3 local shops nearby,1
Handy location for Heathrow express which is needed to catch at 5 25am,1

 Went for a club room Badly designed with bed base taking up way too much space making it hazardous in the night added furniture wasn t helpful and the only plug points were in the drop down desk tv could only be viewed from bed so two chairs were no use and neither was the formal desk bathroom was a wet room cubicle that soaked everything when in use as the shower curtain kept sliding away,0
 The location was amazing the room was fantastic east access to public transport set on the lovely Oosterpark lots of places to eat and drink near by or nice walk to the main areas of Amsterdam I would definitely like to stay here again I only had breakfast at the restaurant on site and this was only once and fairly standard as A brit and a connoisseur of cooked breakfasts I was a little disappointed in the hot food but generally lots on offer for everyone just no where does a cooked breakfast like the English but very helpful staff and a nice place to sit with a coffee and start the day and this is the least of any worries due to their being so many good places to eat around and I personally prefer to wander and explore for my dining experiences But not qualified to give a true opinion of the restaurant it was certainly busy in the evenings which suggests its pretty good I will definitely be staying there again if possible the next time i take a trip to Amsterdam,1

 Room was great reception and front of house excellent as were all staff we came into contact with Breakfast first class and particularly the staff on duty both mornings Considering it was London marathon weekend hotel was very busy on the Saturday morning Well done to all in the restaurant for coping with a smile when they must have felt like screaming ,1
 Light fittings and bathroom door were dirty cooked breakfast was very greasy and not enough electric sockets available ,0
For the money I thought the room could ve been a little bit bigger there was barely enough space to walk around the bed the bathroom was great the breakfast buffet was good but I got food poisoning from the room service food late one night The bedroom walls were all dirty and the trim needed a paint job Needs new wallpaper quite badly and the woodwork throughout the whole body of the place is long overdue for a full restoration I read that it was last done in 1972 so it has a bit of a tired feel The location was OK except for trying to get out to a good club but to be fair there was one in the area that just happened to be closed for an event it s colourful there and it was nice to enjoy the park,1

 Very friendly staff extra warm welcome while checking in Felt like you were expected there anytime Breakfast had a wide variety tasty The room was cleaned every day It had a romantic setting when we arrived ,1
Staff were extremely pleasant and accommodating We were first given a room on the first floor room starting with 1 basement requested a higher floor and were moved on night two to a room on the second floor starting with a 4 for the rest of our stay They were apologetic for not being able to move us on the first night but it was not an issue as we were wiped out from traveling and the beds were extremely comfy First room was nice but very small although the loo was sizeable Second room was more spacious and equally as clean We happened to visit during a warm spell July 20 25 16 and they provided us with ice promptly every evening upon our return Great perk to have a real kettle in the room Good water pressure in the shower mini shampoo etc provided if you forget don t want to bring your own We brought our own power converter but underestimated usage The lovely ladies at the front desk handed over an extra no deposit required Bellman so sorry I cannot remember his name from Bulgaria was so incredibly nice He truly went above and beyond Location an easy walk to both Lancaster Gate tube and Paddington Station A bit off the beaten track which was nice because it was very quiet,1
 The room is a little bit small than what I had initially thought I travelled on my own and didnt spend much time in the room so its alright However it would be a lot better if its just slightly bigger and I have a bit more floor space ,0

 check in staff not helpful lobby small and therefore always crowded Breakfast room feels like a fast food restaurant Far too small when hotel is full especially with families They call it executive rooms although there was no executive lounge Elevators too slow for number of guests Have stayed often in London but this was the least appealing hotel There are certainly many better options ,0
I am so angry that i made this post available via all possible sites i use when planing my trips so no one will make the mistake of booking this place I made my booking via booking com We stayed for 6 nights in this hotel from 11 to 17 July Upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the 2nd floor of the hotel It turned out that this was not the room we booked I had specially reserved the 2 level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings The room itself was ok if you don t mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that contained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it I intimately asked to change the room and after explaining 2 times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next day SO i had to check out the next day before 11 o clock in order to get the room i waned to Not the best way to begin your holiday So we had to wait till 13 00 in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time The room 023 i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window We were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city In the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something it was constant and annoying as hell AND it did not stop even at 2 am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife I have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you want i can send it via e mail The next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so i was offered to change the room once again the hotel was fully booked and they had only 1 room left the one that was smaller but seems newer,0
 Everything about this hotel,1
 The size of the room could be greater but our criticism on this point is minor You could arrange for a common pot for tips The staff was excellent but we were told that one only pays tips to a given person for services rendered e g porter I wanted my tip to be placed for the benefit of all the staff ,0
 Just loved the hotel and spa,1

 Stylish hotel in a great location for exploring London Rooms very well appointed and comfortable Really enjoyed our stay here ,1
 Beautiful room quiet location comfortable bed friendly staff particularly the receptionists who helped store the luggage and giving directions when requested,1
 The breakfast was the only positive element of this hotel original in taste and a good selection of selection of health food dishes on the buffet We did not try the restaurant but the whole set up with its view and terrace on the park is exceptional We had a wedding in the hotel s chapel so the convenience of just walking upstairs after the party was our reason of selecting this location ,1
 They were renovating at Xmas time scaffolding out front and fireplaces not being used and lounges pushed together We had booked many months beforehand and were not advised of this Should have been offered discount and given opportunity of going elsewhere Also toilet hard to use as it was too close to basin and shower I was very disappointed,0
 Rooms are too small No chairs to sit on Poor set up had trouble accessing the safe because of location set up ,0
 The staff we encountered were absolutely delightful and very helpful The rooms were clean stylish and comfortable The hotel was conveniently located within walking distance of the centre of Amsterdam ,1

Staff were friendly and professional location was great for central London soho was 15 mins walk There was a multi storey car park just on the next Street which was quite cheap Loved the stay here found a cafe just down the road which did a lovely full english for 5 95,1
 Our room was incredibly small The hotel rooms look lovely in the photographs but in reality seem a little tired and run down We paid a very reasonable rate for the room through Booking Com which was reserved several months in advance but we noticed that the general prices closer to the date were hugely inflated at prices that could not be justified for what you actually get Also the communal toilets in basement Not great when group of rowdy young men burst in when wife alone ,0
 Bed was very comfy ,1

 The location is far away in terms of walking to marble arch oxford and regent street There is a hotel almost have the same name with one word different in the end of the road which makes the taxis some times lost and confused Not enough electric socket and not close to bed for phone charging The room is too small comparing to other hotels with the same class Not recommended to families due to small rooms Check there official website before book via booking com as some times you will find it cheaper and comes with breakfast ,0

 Finding no car park when I had chosen a hotel with a car park was very annoying There was no real place to drop off our bags so we walked from the hospital car park some way The staff were a bit abrupt not really listening I asked for another pillow in the morning and when none arrived by evening I called reception They said one coming very soon I had to ring again and was told his colleague had been told Some time later I had said I wanted to go to bed the pillow arrived with the explanation he was busy and had forgotten I took the opportunity to ask if we could cool the room down as we were so warm the night before The answer was no but we could have a fan I said no because I did not want to risk waiting ,0
The fact we got separated as a family we booked 2 double rooms and a triple room so we could all be together but rooms were split across 3 levels and a mother and 2 kids meant for the family room had to be split up due to maintenance in the family room that nobody notified us about so caused some upset for the kids could of been a bit more efficient as waited at least an hour of our time to sort this out overall,0

 There was obviously a drainage problem in the bathroom so the room smelled terrible I wished I d complained earlier as when I did complain it was too late for the hotel to do anything about it and they didn t seem too bothered about it either The hotel is pretty tired and the staff weren t very friendly either not the best experience we have had ,0

 We needed gluten free breakfast and ordered it beforehand but the serving was not safe The toasts were but nothing else not The table was set up in the way that cross contamination was difficult to avoid Also bacon eggs and potato cakes were cooked in the same oven and served together Potato cakes had gluten including flours They seemed to have no idea what exactly it all means to serve safe gluten free food ,0

 Hotel Russell is my preferred hotel in London The Piccadilly line takes you from the airport directly to the hotel Russell station and then you are in the central part of London close to the British Museum and many historic sites The hotel itself is historic and charming and is undergoing renovations The only downside is the lack of airconditioning the room did have a fan ,1
 Friendly and helpful staff I imagine it is a nice hotel if you could access it all During our stay it was covered in scaffold and the whole first floor was out of bounds which includes the dining breakfast room,1

 Bed was ok not great room really small staff very friendly I basically slept there and was out the whole day so it s quite expensive to just sleep and shower but generally a decent deal,1
 The receptionists were not polite their English wasn t even that good to begin with The room was very tiny you could barely pass by the bed if I was a bit fatter I wouldn t be able to pass The bed sheets were not changed since day one there were stains The toilet was so tiny and the shower was horrible there is no way to shower without drowning the entire toilet The location wasn t that great and it took us a while to get in and out of the area ,0
 I have stayed at the Russell before and am pleased to see the refurbishment work continues The staff were all attentive and sought to ensure I was having a pleasant stay ,1
The shower flooded the bathroom and hallway as there was no seal on the shower door and the plugs in bath and sink were no draining sue to clogged hair when we booked via booking com it initially said breakfast included however it was no and actually ended up costing an extra 40 pounds for two people breakfast was minimal consisting of one sausage a spoonful of beans and 1 bacon and tomato and small black pudding was not much of a selection of cheese etc just a couple of bits that had been out a while,0
 Lots of road works going on having to pay for the Internet also breakfast not included in the price expensive but in a good location ,0
 Well hidden from Paddington station when dark area unknown,0
 It took a little longer than expected for for the room service to be cleared from outside our room But that is being ultra fussy as it wasnt left inside the room ,0
 The reception staff mundane lethargic not welcoming they need customer service skills they are the only thing that i found wrong with this hotel With the exception of an Asian male receptionist who smiled welcomed people ,0
 Quick response to change my room when I had been given a dirty grotty tired run down room which I had upgraded to deluxe ,1

There seems to be some miscommunication between this hotel and Booking com We arrived on Christmas day and the hotel was fully booked Upon arrival it turned out that we were allocated two rooms on two separate floors even though I specifically indicated we require either a suite or two connected rooms as we have four little children I even received an email confirmation from the hotel s reservation center for this The staff at the front desk was super very nice and they did their best to solve the issue Eventually they upgraded us to a penthouse at the 14th floor which was great The troubles continued the next day and every day thereafter as my booking for breakfast did not go through either and they had to charge me for each breakfast,0

Just returned from a wonderful weekend at the apex temple court Where to start From the amazing upgrade for my husbands 30th birthday to the personalised handwritten note and chocolates left for us in the room everything was perfect from the start The hotel is in a great location less than 10 minutes walk to Covent Garden and for location alone is great value I had chosen the hotel as we were attending the aldwych theatre and it was literally around the corner It s clean modern and our room was to die for with a balcony offering views of the London eye The apex offers so many extra touches with the free jelly beans Pringles and of course the apex duck We had a great nespresso machine in our room and robes and slippers all added to make the perfect stay They really have thought about everything We have stayed in many hotels in London but would definately choose apex again,1
 The room was very small and quite shabby and tired looking The actual building itself is beautiful but the decor is very tired looking and scruffy in places Our tiny room looked over the back of the hotel and was of rubbish skips that had overflowed onto the path so not very pleasant to look at In view of all this we felt it was very overpriced ,0

Great location superbly helpful staff they provide a computer and printer so I was able to print off my boarding passes easily Room was very clean and bed comfortable didn t dine at the hotel but the afternoon tea looked amazing will try it next time Just opposite Hyde park and next to the tube station however we walked as weather was nice and it only took us 35 minutes to walk to Victoria Apollo theatre to watch the show I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be central but also in a nice and peaceful location Saturday morning walking through Hyde park was picturesque Also staff offer city maps and guides or any personal recommendations for those who don t know London very well The foyer is beautiful very exquisite and grand In my opinion a very good value for money hotel would ve paid twice that I paid for our stay was a great place to show my partner what London has to offer,1
Early check in is not possible approx 2 hours early Only one chair in double room in a such Luxurious Hotel,0
 Rooms are too small not enough or to be correct almost no wardrobe space and a useless entry space without even a few hooks that area could be used at least to hang your coat hat or a few stuff,0
I would not normally Mark somewhere 10 out of 10 but as soon as we got there the staff were friendly and helpful the room was excellent There was a nice seating area outside where the wife could have a smoke while we had a drink When we went out in the evening there was a good selection of bars and restaurants within a short walking distance In the morning there was a good selection for breakfast we both had a full English breakfast which was cooked to perfection,1

Reception staff We paid in full upon arrival and got charged the entire amount 3 times again They were argumentative and refused to believe us so we had to show them our account statement We also got charged small random amounts each day and there were 8 extra things on our mini bar bill that we didn t have It was lucky we checked the charges They refused to be at all apologetic or seem empathetic,0

 Our room wasn t ready when we got to our room and had to wait an hour for it to be cleaned,0

 Lovely hotel very well presented staff tried hardest to help you Had everything you needed and breakfast was amazing ,1
When I arrived there was a red blood looking stain on the bed cover and hairs near the toilet in the bathroom Drinks were very expensive and room maids entered our room in the morning 4 5 times despite us telling them we did not require room maids which i m really not happy about We also started a tab in the bar which we agreed to pay upon checkout on our final day we then had a phone call at 1am whilst we were sleeping to tell us that the bill had to be paid instantly before they shut their tills It s such a shame because the location is excellent,0

I wonder why we could not choose the table when we had a breakfast Is it separated by race or rank of room we are Japanese I hope not This is the first hotel which the staves designated our table And the tables we were shown were not so comfortable Besides I would like to request to improve the breakfast And about our room honestly I regreted not asking to change another room I wanted have stayed my mother at the room which is better lighted and better view even if I paid extra fee because it was my mother s last 3 days of staying in London,0

 I didn t feel safe within the hotel and unfortunately had problems on the night of my boyfriends birthday as a man who wasn t staying at the hotel was very drunk We he to get staff to come redo the bed sheets which was really embarrassing finding pubic hair on our sheets The hotel did do us a upgrade as we was scared the man that was very drunk threatened us The police was called sadly it did ruined our night and the upgraded room wasn t special enough to save our trip personally I wouldn t recommend the hotel I had saved to take my boyfriend to London ,0

 Great breakfast Great help with suitcases and with my sons pram every time we left the hotel ,1
 Hotel was in a perfect location for us close to lots of the Paris attractions metro station just across the street ,1
You advertised breakfast included in your booking com web posting When I completed the booking it did not indicate breakfast included Misleading I emailed you at booking com and received auto reply with no direct follow up to my inquiry I asked hotel staff at check in and was not offered the breakfast Your booking service is less than satisfactory in this regard The hotel is not 500 metres from Paddington Closer to 1200 metres,0
 Small cramped suite with noisy air con that kept us awake,1
Room 504 fabulous,1
 The room was spacious and the beds comfortable,1

 The quality of the mattress of the bed was really bad For the money I paid I expected at least a decent mattress ,0
 Elevators were kind of small and slow and for some reason many people were riding them up and back down again for no apparent reason they are glass but the view is only the inside atrium making them crowded ,0
10 for two small bottles of water was a bit steep given everything else is excellent value Could hear the guest next door easily at night,0
 We were given what I would describe as someone s flat that they let us have for the weekend It had two separate bathrooms one with a shower the other with a bath The sink in the bath bathroom did not work The staff basically said oh well The room had scuffs on the walls the carpet needed replacing and the bathrooms were obviously in disrepair The room was supposed to be of modern design but fell flat They should embrace the history of the hotel and reflect that in their rooms and service ,0

I booked a deluxe twin room As per the photos it looked good enough When we got into the room which was hardly 3m x 3m I thought I made a mistake because it had a king size bed with two single mattresses on it with 10 cm gap between them instead of two single beds we went to the reception to check they said this is the only available room and we can t give you your money back The room was so tiny we hardly had any space for our baggage Staff all look unhappy the breakfast experience is even worse Good staff but greedy greedy management and owners Really bad experience,0
 All the staff where very friendly and helpful The food was excellent and a great choice The rooms where lovely as well ,1

It s very close to another hotel with almost the same name so we went to the wrong one first not really their fault Checking in was very chaotic it was very busy Some people had been double booked Also when we went to check in at 2 15pm one of the rooms wasn t ready as they had a late check out which I didn t think was a very good excuse The hotel was OK but it was expensive for what you got it s the location you re paying for,0

 This is a grande olde Dame of a hotel very charming right opposite Russell Square It is undergoing careful renovation but this is not noticeable or bothersome I stayed near the top floors and renovation has not reached there as yet I quite liked that fact and I have to say it was very nice to stay in such an olde hotel Some reviewers have criticised the older rooms but I did not find fault and I stayed in a small double Everything worked wifi was high speed water was very hot TV had plenty channels Housekeeping was very good I have stayed in very upmarket hotels over the years and yes Russell is showing her age at the top but this is being repaired A brief problem on the floor with a tripped fuse was resolved within ten minutes by Maintainance unlike a previous Hotel Du Vin that I stayed in where they did not even fix an issue in my room my entire stay so very very good staff taking care of everything All the staff from the Doormen Conci rge to Reception were very nice and helpful to me Sometimes I think guests have a duty to be decent guests also and respect the olde spirt of the hotel you stay in regarding negative reviewers on this site Walking down the staircase was lovely each morning and the emerging marble lower down was fantastic you must meet George the lucky dragon he brought great luck to me that week of my stay Good olde Grande Dame Lovely staff Will benefit from her renovation within ,1

 The bathroom needs update the layout is awkward and the faucet is old Also the bathtub door is half way there is no way to avoid water on the floor while taking a shower Secondly the beds are not comfortable enough The hotel can do a little bit considering the rate charged on each room Lastly the air freshener used by housekeeping after daily cleaning smells terrible please change it ,0

Room claustrophically small Very dark decor Even with all the room lights on it was very difficult to see what you were reading or look at a map Lighting better in bathroom which was were we planned the day out If you put your suitcase at bottom of bed there was no floor walking space Handles on chest of drawers came off everytime you opened one Safe wouldn t program right so didn t use it Skimpy small hard towels in bathroom Hotel further out than it appeared on maps to main tourist attractions On line photos made hotel look modern luxurious and large It s a very small lobby and maximum 2 suitcases and 2 people in elevator Hated stepping off elevator into darkened hallway This was due to economy lighting and dark wood and dark colours on walls A few steps brought the hallway lights on and in general place was quaint couldn t imagine coping with kids in such small twin room We d requested separate twin beds but basically got a divided bed with one headboard We made do but was not ideal for two separate adults to use Was ok for purpose used but not one I would recommend to others,0
 We loved the location Close to many attractions that we went to see as well as the cenotaph ,1

 very comfortable room and excellent staff They welcomed us at the hotel with smiles and upgraded our room to a club room for the night for no extra money we ordered room service and the food was absolutely amazing with no exceptions we had salad soup and two main courses all of which we couldnt finish because of the plentiful portions It was not expensive either I am definitely planning on staying at this hotel again or one of others in their chain of hotels Theres plenty of room to keep clothes in built in closets and the shower is great as well Overall an excellent and cozy experience ,1

The only down side to the hotel is the beds and pillows First the pillows are like bricks I recommend taking your own pillow if you have to you wake up with sore red ears off them Also the beds are not too comfy could be better I didn t want to think what our room would of been like without the free upgrade But overall for the price I paid which was 153 it wasn t bad as that included breakfast for 2 You can pay a lot more in London for the same service,0

 Beautiful building external and internal which makes you feel like you are staying somewhere special Very handy for the theatre which was the reason for our trip ,1
Don t be deceived by the pictures of the bedrooms Booked a Double Delux Room but when we got to the room it now seems we actually had a Compact Double Room though reception confirmed we had a Delux after we complained about the room size however now re looking at photos of a Compact Double Room that is what we had Very small double single bed with no real cupboard space enough for 2 shirts on either side of the bed some drawer space no room to put anything even your suitcase Bathroom was a wet room Did not pay for expensive breakfast and instead had breakfast on the way out in a cheaper cafe which are close by,0

Although I wrote through booking com two different request and question to the hotel I never got an answer for the question and for the request only on the day of arrival The breakfast area is very small and though we were lucky and never had to wait but if you arrive around 9am be prepared to wait Some of the waiters are not always on the top of their job had to ask several times to refill eg milk and also came across a bad fruit salad once But overall nothing major and the good intention is there Last thing we were unlucky I guess our room for 3 was on the 2nd floor looking to the train station meaning bad view and WiFi was fairly weak in or room,0

I booked a deluxe double and was told that the room had a queen size bed However the bed was pretty small The duvet was quite thin so I had to call down reception at 3am for a blanket Also the room was very small quite claustrophobic The next morning after checking out we went to the bar to have a coffee We are the only ones there the barman took our order then disappeared for 15 minutes and didn t make our coffees so we left Not good service at all,0
The room was very small for the price and the wet room toilet was very very small so if you had a shower it would get the whole floor wet The room was hot and we could only open the windows about 2 inches,0
Breakfast was 18 00 each which is very overpriced and even more so for small children Not too sure where the decking area was where you can have a drink which is displayed in the pictures overlooking the London eye which is misleading,0

 they dont have separate bed base for twin room but mattress are separate shower is small and i can hear upper room shower,0
 Booked and paid for a twin deluxe room They gave me a broom cupboard with a very small double bed which I had to share with my teenage son ,0
 I like the bed and large pillows especially All is good except the room is a bit small ,1
The room was spotless was in a very quiet location even though off of Fleet Street only 15 mins walk to Covent Garden Theatres Very luxurious room with huge King bed enormous pillows Beautiful,1
 The room was overall filthy i doubt if the bed sheets were changed before my arrival and the toilet cleaned found human hair in both The corridor smelled burned cooking oil from the kitchen It was one of the most disgusting hotels I ve stayed at It certainly didn t worth the amount of money i paid for it ,0
Rooms are too small there is no water or mini bar available at rooms Small water is offered within the price almost given every hotel including 3 stars rooms are too cold and the heating system of the room is not sufficient to heat the room,0

 Staff very friendly Location was very good for me ,1
 There is nothing significant to dislike As a way to improve they should provide the following two things especially for families with little kids liquid handwash in the bathroom bottled drinking water because the tap water may not be suitable for young children most hotels around the world in this price range do not charge for water for kids ,0
 Very comfortable room and within easy walking distance of tube and bus shops near to local attractions,1
 At arrival I was assigned to a room that looked more as a closet or pantry than a guest room It had a step right at the entrace and it was so small that two persons were not able to stand around the room at the same time Then we asked for a room change then we were transferred to a larger room not big with a bed barely capable to fit a couple of a standard size The lobby is depressing it seems to be from the Queen Victoria era ,0
 Location Close to railway station ,1
 Upgraded room fabulous view excellent service great location,1

Superfriendly staff comfortable beds safe in the closet and the housekeeping was superb they even made the bed extra nice for my daughter by tucking in her Teddybears 3 Clean bathroom nice shower and the room was nice and quiet for my daughter to sleep in the evening Unfortunately it was winter so we did not get the opportunity to spend time in the garden but it made a nice view from the window in our room and at the breakfast table The underground is only a 2 minute walk so getting around was very easy I am overall very satisfied with my stay at this hotel and would recommend it,1

 A room with a broken and leaking shower should not be given to guests Neither the reservation system nor the receptionists do understand that a female guest s family name can consist of two parts like maiden name plus husband s name while the respective husband has just one name This lead to the problem that an important parcel has not been accepted for which my husband was eagerly waiting Instead it was sent back by the receptionist ,0

Up on check out i was inform that they didn t charge anything to my credit card I was asked to pay by Cash I paid my bill including room charge by cash over 1674 pounds They have Charged 1000 upon arrival to my credit card and another 2660 on Checkout I have inform my bank and waiting for the answer I will file this to court This was really disappointing,0

That i Had to change hotel first Because hot Water did not work at this property So i payed for 4 nigts in a suite But the first Night at the other hotel i just got a normal room,0
 We were allowed to check in an hour early with no fuss We just used the hotel as a base for somewhere to read charge on the evening The stay was pleasant and would not think twice about returning ,1
 The rooms were cold Although nice the room decor was basic and unwelcoming It could use some design help an area rug or two ,0
No Negative,0
 The room was spacious but chilly and the traffic noise from outside prevented us from having a good nights sleep There were two very large windows in the room both single glazed so outside noise was easily heard in the room ,0

 The bed was very comfortable Room was quite big with enough space to move around It was also very silent no noise from outside or other rooms Location was fabulous very nice area and near two metro stations very close to the park for daily morning exercise,1
 Nothing worth mentioning ,0
 No bad experiences at all,0
 Our room seemed hidden away in the bowels of the hotel It did have a large frosted window but when examined it clearly looked out on to a manky neglected ourdoor light shaft ,0
 The accommodations to shows and tourist attraction are fantastic ,1
For the hold on my credit card they took a physical impression on carbon paper Can t prove this is related but that same evening I had a fraudulent charge on my card for 0 99 on iTunes The hotel was great but I don t think I will allow anyone to take an impression of my card again,0
 Clean fresh well appointed rooms very tidy in a great location,1
 Great building superb staff and clean and comfortable,1
 The bathroom is on the smaller side ,0
I stayed in room 621 at checkout reception didn t ask if I had a good stay and I forgot to mention my complaint as I was in a hurry heading off for a meeting room 621 has an adjoining door the noise from the next room into mine was ridiculous the door may as well have been left open I enjoyed multiple different people staying in the room next to me think 622 over course of my stay and was continually awoken at times ranging from midnight to 2 30am in the morning I don t think they realised how think the space was between the adjoining doors this would put me off staying again at this hotel,0
 very noisey place and we were woken up each morning early by the cleaners we did not sleep very well in the two nights we stayed ,0
 The shower leaked under the door into the bedroom and the bathroom floor was also very slippery The bedroom was far too hot and couldn t be cooled down ,0
This is the forth time I have used this group of hotels and the 2nd time I have turned up and had the excuse of there is a problem with the boilers and you have been affected and we will have to relocate you I told them to stop using the same excuse when they overbook the hotel as it does not work for me They tried to convince me to go to South Kensington Hotel which is told rubbish I managed to get another room in the hotel Just very poor attitude to use on customers,0
Within 10 minutes walk of Paddington station which has the underground availability,1
 Staff were professional hotel was very good,1

 The bathroom coiuld have been cleaned a little better each day ,0
 Room was a little on the small side,0
 Staff were difficult to locate when wanting to order drinks etc in bar on multiple occasions,0
 We chose to decline the breakfast as it was overpriced and London has so much more to offer when it comes to food Pillows were too chunky,0

 Location is the downside there are a lot of refugees outside HOWEVER it is not as severe as any of the reviews I have seen previously Yes there are quite a lot and I can see how some may be slightly intimidated There are only quite a lot on the walk to the metro but we were never hassled nor stared at or made to feel uncomfortable Police presence further up away from the hotel where the refugees are ,0

 Couldn t open my balcony door Bed was far to soft and uncomfortable Mattress needs replacing Breakfast was plentiful but the ingredients were cheap This impacted on the taste which was not good at all Eggs tasted powered sausages tasted like they had been cooked the day before Bacon had absolutely no flavour Cereals tasted old and we re obviously the cheaper brands Orange juice was out of a long life carton I m sure It s a shame the hotel obviously try s to save money on the breakfast as this is a guests last memory of the property and it s not good I was not the only guest unhappy with it judging by the guarded whispers heard at the breakfast table ,0

Cost of the executive double room same as our usual classic double room clearly dishonest Shower bathroom in executive older and not as helpful as the walk in shower in classic Air con did not work So called mini bar is not a mini bar but a bare fridge We have been here many times but the added cost over 100 a night for fewer facilities amenities has upset us a great deal,0
 Hotel staff were very welcoming and helpful Room was large with bonus of fridge microwave which would have been great if stopping longer Superb freshly cooked breakfast ,1

 Close to a lot of things and that added walk will do you the world of good Although on Fleet Street it s tucked away and suffers little from street traffic noise The bed was probably the best I have ever slept in ,1
 Room is small even I had Ana studio king for family,0
 One thing we found strange is that you had to reserve the time you will go to take the breakfast from the day before or you might not find a table and will have to wait ,0

 Plumbing quite noisy Room not large enough to have a chair to sit in Breakfast was additional and a little expensive ,0
 Our room was lovely and modern with everything you could need The Club Lounge was a lovely peaceful space to have breakfast in and then later relax in and have a refreshment after a busy day sightseeing ,1
 If you are staying with someone who you aren t comfortable sharing every little detail with we wouldn t recommend this hotel The glass box in the corner of the room that doubles as the en suite has practically see through glass even though it s black so you can t be concerned about protecting your modesty Nearly all the guests we came across we re British but there was a complete lack of English Breakfast tea in the restaurant where you had breakfast What made it stranger was we told them it was available in the tea coffee facilities in the room but only with powdered milk but they still couldn t produce any for breakfast The hotel was also undergoing serious renovation works at the time Which didn t really affect us other than when they decided to start taking the ceiling of the restaurant down while they were serving breakfast ,0

 Called up hotel to ask if I could leave a bag two days prior to check in and was informed this was OK On coming to the hotel I was informed I could not do so I would not have minded if I was given the correct information when I first called Secondly the receptionist on duty did not handle the situation well she was unsympathetic and said I may have misunderstood what was told to me by phone implying either I do not understand simple English or perhaps am too stupid to understand The halogen lights in the room are too bright and glaring ,0
 Breakfast was not good I had the advocado toast and it was tasteless My daughter had the potatoe rosti and it was awful soggy and greasy ,0
 Price of alcoholic drinks at the hotel s bar ,0
 The appearance of the hotel was lovely and the staff were very helpful,1
 Found the bed for the children very uncomfortable it was a pull out sofa bed Unfortunately they didn t sleep very well We had a studio room with a different layout on this occasion the rooms were only partitioned with a desk and pillar rather than the bathroom which makes it more practical so it wasn t as seperate as we would have liked and as easy for them to get to sleep unless we turned our lights off too might be worth requesting this with the hotel ,0
I stayed here with my other half for one night in December I put down a special request on my booking as we were celebrating our one year anniversary we arrived slightly early at the hotel at 13 30 but check in was 14 00 unfortunately the room wasn t ready yet but they held our bags for us and we went out As planned and checked in a bit later on Once we arrived in our room later on it was beautifully decorated with 2 Swan Towel s on the bed with real roses all round the bed Little things like this go a very long way so thank you very much,1
Comfy duvet spacious studio Ideal for up to 4 adults great view of the London eye and a special message on the window written for my birthday wishes and a bottle of wine balloons Front reception staff were very welcoming and professional,1
 Rooms were very good and clean Even comes with free cable TV,1

 Hotel too old definitely need a renovation Smelly drainage problem and rusty toilet utilities Dark room smaller than what the photos shown noisy refrigerators Changed the room twice and waste a lot of my time without any compensation not even a late check out for free The staff is helpful but seems they are adapted to the complains I doubt these problems are usual ,0
 Nothing none,0
 Very friendly staff and family friendly as described Lovely room with view of the London Eye Nice restaurant Location is great ideal for exploring the sights of Westminster the South Bank beyond and easy access to other areas ,1
 The view from our upgraded room was fab ,1
The first room allocated was a lower ground room which was dark and very small We relocated to room 508 which was the same size as the first ie very small We hardly had room to move around in what was advertised as a super delux room Both rooms were smaller than you get in a modern budget hotel at twice the cost Room 508 did not have a ventilation system in the toilet this was corrected after I mentioned it Also the complete sink tap system had come away from the wall I guess it did work,0
 Room was a big small could have been more spacious,0
 Great location beautiful building,1
 Our second stay and again a thoroughly enjoyable visit ,1
 The hotel was old but well looked after loved the entrance and stair case ,1

Receptionist attitude on checking in to be told they didn t have 2 rooms next to each other even though an email had been sent requesting this and a reply received back says no this had been noted and was no problems,0
 The stairs the poky room with more steps immediately inside to the sleeping area making entry with bags very difficult Small bathroom and lack of ventilation and a rock hard bed ,0
 Across the road from Hyde Park ,1
I loved the hotel design and decoration Staff were extremely nice always helpful and smiling That is something you really appreciate when you are on a 24 hour business trip Breakfast was way better than I expected although coffee was quite bad That is something most hotels fail to nail and I think most guests find it important Rooms are fantastically cozy clean and comfortable,1
 The room had no sweetner and very little milk for coffee s or tea for the time we were there ,0

 Situation of hotel was in a quiet area Location was not the closest to Paddington Station for Heathrow Express but it was still within reasonable walking distance The staff in the lobby were excellent and very customer oriented ,1

The toilet extractor did not work and the toilet had a bad smell There is no aircon Lucky for us it was cool weather but I can imagine in hot months it can get very uncomfortable The area is not safe We walked to the metro station and nearly got attacked by a very aggressive black man that approached us in a very suspicious and aggressive manner and swore at us We just kept walking faster and went into the metro station It was very scary as we had our 10 month old baby with us We are so grateful the man did not hurt us,0
 Staff were fantastic,1
 Great location clean comfortable room with bath and great shower,1
It was very very pricey to stay here The breakfast on day 2 had a long line and it did not seem that they had an organized plan to seat people for breakfast,0

 Everything else I booked an executive studio room and upgraded to city view the other week The stay was for myself and my parents I havent seen them in a long time and it was meant to be a family weekend out before I get married Firstly booking com has advertised the room I was booking with a picture of the room with a view to London Eye or Big Ben Did we get that view Not at all And we could barely get in the room as the sofa bed was so close to the door My mom is disabled so I went to the reception and told them that they must have gotten the room incorrect So they changed our room to a Junior Suite which just had a window overlooking the waterloo train station I have told one of the staff members that we upgraded on booking com and had to have a view to Big ben or London eye which they said is not their fault and theres the Shard building somewhere far away that we can slightly see and because the Shard is in the city this is the City view You can say that pretty much about anything I appreciate they changed our room to a bigger one until I realised that the Spa bookings I have made for myself and my mother have not been made Complained to the reception they said its not their fault again and they can try and fit one of us in at some point during our stay There were missing bulbs in pretty much every lamp in the room my moms duvet had a blood stain on have photo proof I have also requested to have an extra duvet as my parents dont like sharing one had to ask twice although it was written in the notes The next morning after the room was cleaned the extra duvet was gone again I have never had a worse stay in a hotel in my life ,0

Anyways the staff was extremely friendly no complants there Location of the hotel is about 1km from the nearest metro station The rooms were tidy and the beds were good to sleep in However there where several small faulty details unfinished renovation in the room like lamp on the floor nails sticking out of floor which rips your sock etc so nothing major but adding them all together it makes this as a three star hotel in my opinnion,1

 No normal t bags,0
Stairs our room is located between the ground and the 1st floor so no direct lift access We had to carry our big suitcases from stairs Gladly the hotel staffs were really helpful with our luggages The room was a bit narrow but perfectly acceptable given the price and being in London,0

 Breakfast could be better More yogurt choices larger croissants more fresh fruit Service was great there and in the bar Cappuccino was bitter Machine may need cleaning ,0
 Slightly further away from tube stations but good bus links and ttaxis,0
 The rooms were incredibly small which was challenging for us travelling with a lot of luggage We were offered a club room but the extra space was minimal and the bathroom even smaller than in the standard ,0
 Shower was a bit different to work taps slightly broken and the tap you pull up was broken ,0
 The reception staff were really unhelpful and glum They never smiled Almost any request was too much trouble In a hotel that has no swimming pool or public rooms the reception staff are key These appear to have been poorly selected trained and not proactively managed A poor reflection of the brand and hotel ,0
The location was great and the staff was super friendly and eager to help The breakfast had more items than I expected For example I don t drink caffeinated drinks or coffee and they had a brewed herbal tea To my surprise they had both regular yogurt and Greek yogurt had a machine that squeezed fresh orange juice by the glass and there were other pleasant surprises Also our room was in the old part of the hotel and had a view of the Eiffel Tower That was a totally unexpected treat Although I also listed it in the negatives the elevator in the old part of the hotel was comically small It could barely fit 1 person I don t know how the bellman got our 2 suitcases and 2 rolling carryons into it I imagine he put them in the elevator pressed the floor button and raced it to our floor 4th,1

 The breakfast was pretty good I wish the eggs were cooked a little longer It seems people in UK like their eggs runny Due to construction we were moved to sister property so we missed out on the character of the older property,0
The staff could not have been more obliging I arrived direct from Australia was seriously unwell They are definitely worth more than 5 5 for sevice,1
the only downside was the size of wardrobe not very deep and no chest of draws only bedside draws we stayed 2 nights so wasn t too much of a problem but if you had more luggage not much storage,0
 Room was a bit cold and only a plug in radiator to warm it up Ventilation system made an annoying humming noise every so often ,0
I didn t like the breakfast for the price it cost I ve stayed at other 4 Star hotels with much more variety The bed creaked and in order to open the door with the card I had to make several attempts,0

The room was very noisy we could hear a fan of some sort outside the bedroom which came on periodically and was very loud Every time someone in a room next door above or close to us flushed the loo or had a shower we could hear the water running through the bathrooms open drain The room was very small only one arm chair so when we had room service in the evening one of us had to sit on the bed to eat There is only enough wardrobe space for about 5 things to hang in When I asked why I hadn t got any complementary water I was told it was because I booked through you I made a fuss and did get it in the end but I felt like a cheap skate even though it cost me over 350 for the two nights,0

 Unfortunately there was not enough storage space in our room One small hanging space and two small bedside drawers is not enough for a stay of three nights It meant that we were not even able to partially unpack our cases I would have liked more space for our personal toiletries in the bathroom as well ,0
 Room was small as only slightly larger than bed Themed rooms with photos of American icons was strange for being in Paris Costly to be expected in Paris though ,0

Excellent location all facilities in the room are in good shape new Liked the old fashion feel of the place Very close to 2 tube stations,1
The room was small but we knew that before arrival I just didn t think that paying an extra 40 for a room that I wasn t going to spend much time in warranted it The wardrobe didn t mark sense as it was so thin you couldn t actually hang anything in it The hairdryer was in the wardrobe and the mirror on the back of the door that didn t open wide enough to look in to blow dry your hair Parking was a nightmare as you have to park 10 minutes away and trudge back with your luggage This wasn t mentioned before booking I wish the hotel would have had a link to booking which is under Waitrose and was 40 for two night The price wasn t that bad it was just the nightmare of walking back and forth with luggage The location was good close to Paddington and Lancaster Gate we walked to oxford street as it was so close and the weather was fab,1
 Very welcoming staff Room was clean,1
 I like everything could not fault it,0
Incorrect payment my credit card was charged twice first time on the arrival send time when we leave When I found this I tried to get my money back It is already almost 20 days 5 emails written and still did not get my money back Never go there again,0
 When we arrived our city view consisted of the train station next to the hotel Asked for a room with a proper city view and the only available room was the penthouse at cost Decided to upgrade and it was worth every penny ,0
Personally we found the room rather claustrophobic difficult to explain the layout as the outside of the room was actually inside the building so had no view or natural daylight which was quite confusing at 2 45 this morning when I happened to wake Just felt like we state of semi darkness the whole time we spent in the room Fine for one night but had we have had a longer stay I would have to have asked if they had an outward facing room I don t like to sound like a cheapstake but breakfast was 18 each we opted to take a 5 minute walk around the corner and found a small decent caf and had a very adequate breakfast for 5 each,0

 The hotel is clean and well located between both Temple and Chancery Lane tube stations but not exactly that close to them The room size is very good clean and you ll find everything you need The bed is more for the very soft kind I personally would prefer them to be neither soft nor hard Staff is efficient and very kind ,1

Large queues for breakfast Room was very crammed booked a room for 2 adults and 2 children no space to go in with a pushchair Not enough lifts to cater for guests at times it took us 10 minutes to go down to the lobby restaurant,0

 The location suited us very well The staff were very friendly ,1
 At peak times the queue line for breakfast could be long but either the family room would be open additional seating upstairs or the line would move fairly quickly ,0

 Very friendly staff and the room was nice and clean and big ,1
The hotel is being renovated Which means that you will literally be drilled out of your bed starting at 7am We paid EUR350 for a large room but really it was not worth the money,0
 Nice room relaxing Good food Close to where we wanted to go,1
 Very nice hotel quiet setting within an inner courtyard Terrace will be lovely in summer plus also very quiet I imagine Very pleasant staff and good hotel bar I didn t use the restaurant neither for breakfast or evening so can t comment ,1
 Great location away from busy tourist areas but easy and quick access to West End Exmouth market where we went to eat on one night Could walk easily to Convent Garden and Soho and lots of buses to points beyond Very friendly staff excellent martinis at the bar Rooms clean spacious comfortable ,1
 Despite being a gorgeous hotel with unique history Hotel Russell remains surprisingly affordable and feels like any luxury hotel should The staff are as helpful and well trained as they are friendly and personable I also appreciated the restaurant and beautiful bar which offered a more well rounded experience vs just a rented room I look forward to coming back throughout the years to come ,1
the manager of hotel wants to pay all the money there but in greece there is not the opportinity to take more than 480 euros per week and she didnt accept the card which we have already sent in order to pay the rooms,0
 The Superior Room was very comfortable The location of the hotel along Fleet Street was a comfortable walking distance to Covent Garden If you chose not to walk there are buses just outside the hotel that takes you to there or to Trafalgar Square ,1
 Staff excellent Location really good They went the extra mile to provide child friendly equipment ,1
Facilities were not as great as I was advised I ordered milk for my twins and got charged 5 00 but was half a cup the rest was froth,0

 The staff particularly the porters were very friendly and more than happy to talk to you and make you feel welcome Serge provided us with a detailed history of the building and local area ,1
 Everything can t wait to stay again would definitely recommend this hotel would use this brand in other locations,1
 Small Very small room ,0
 The bar is beautiful and the service there was great ,1
 The hotel like many central London hotels for obvious reasons doesn t have its own car park and the excellent one right next to it that we usually use was closed due to road works and layout changes We found one online at Upper Marsh which had the advantage of booking in advance and has an attendant but it is more expensive and on getting home we found a nail in one tyre and a screw put into another and couldn t think where else it could have happened There are other parking options not too far away particularly if your vehicle doesn t need the high clearance room ours does Will ask the hotel for parking advice in advance next time or fly ,0

 I was advised that the restaurant was closed on Sundays which was a pity as the friend I was meeting and I would have liked to eat there The only thing missing was a bathrobe I d have enjoyed a bathrobe subsequent hotels during my trip all had them but the hotels themselves weren t as good ,0
 The furniture in the room was a little worn The desk chair was leather but with a lot of slits and missing leather from it it just felt a little tatty I would also recommend extending the shower door protector screen out a bit further as using the shower to wash hair meant the bathroom got soaked No ironing board in the room though ,0

 Room was very spacious,1
There was a party one evening and the music was very loud until around 2 am I round suggest that families should be higher up in th hotel if there are functions planned,0
The room 138 is small and I do not like having to shower in the toilet area Would much prefer a separate shower cubical this would stop me using this facility if I was given this room again as second time and not happy with the en suite facility Air con was adequate other guest complained of it on the day as well,0

I had requested a quiet room Given room on the 6th floor air conditioning not cooling room but extremely noisy room very hot Blocked bath drain shower faulty water filling the bath from the bath tap while shower on Requested room change Given Room on 2nd floor Windows blocked out no daylight Extreme noise from continual external exhaust fans between 5am until 11pm Worst sleep ever Old noisy air conditioning system also Hotel undergoing major building works not advised of this When booking I booked for 3 nights and wanted to cancel the last night to go elsewhere but hotel unable to advise about cancellation as I had made the booking through Booking com,0
 Can t think of anything that could have been improved ,0
Traffic noise from the street I was on the 3rd floor The overall feel of the hotel is a bit old Entry foyer felt dark and depressing Others would probably say it was atmospheric but it just felt a bit scuffed on the edges with thick paint job to hide the dings,0
No Negative,0

 Room was set up for a family this may have been booking com inheriting my previous details rather than the hotel ,0
Nice hotel with a lot of character and history Nice staff especially Razvann who sorted our issue with the credit card with lots of patience and a friendly manner Breakfast was nice and plentiful Great location just a walk to lots of restarants 5min walk to bus stops and train stations Staff were helpful and provided good information for tourists,1
 Nothing to improve wish I could ve stayed longer ,0
The rooms were very small advertised as a superior double room but it s more like an average bedroom And for the amount paid you would definitely expect a little more the room was so cramped and I felt as though the bed was too big for the room there wasn t enough space to pull the stool out from the vanity mirror draws as the bed was in the way and there was only one side upon could access the bed from Honestly I was very disappointed with this hotel and probably won t be returning to London for a short stay again and if the other hotels are like this I definitely won t it s awful that hotels can charge that much for a room and it be that small Not sure if I may have looked wrong however the photos on the website showed a 4 poster bed which when I purchased the superior double room I expected to get and if what I got was a superior double room I would like to see how big a suite is Another point would be the view I wasn t expecting a lot from the view because obviously it s not up high it s you average house size however The view was very poor however it s understandable that they can t change this but again for the money you pay you would expect a little better One rude female member of staff at reception See first paragraph you don t get what you pay for at this hotel not sure if this is the case throughout London however it is here I am almost 100 sure that I booked the hotel room and I received free breakfast for both myself and my partner however we did not receive one and the female member of staff I previously mentioned was quite rude about it and told me that we had to pay 15 each if we wanted it also of your thinking of site seeing I wouldn t recommend this hotel as it s quite far from the main attractions like the London eye or Houses of Parliament and the Thames but there is a tube station round the corner which was helpful,0
No Negative,0
The hotel good location and clean but some staff very badly with me really I surprised from them They should be more professional and helper all coustmers they need more study and qualify in field hotel business Bcz the price increasing more that 150 that not accepted in any hotels and countries special in UK we like UK Thanks,0
 couldn t work out how to crank DOWN the heating in the room Bathroom is miniscule Mini bar was very limited with its choice,0
The room was dirty dark without view even from the 8th floor The service was slow We asked for an adaptor and we received one two days later Every day during our four night stay we had to queue for breakfast for half an hour The breakfast room was small and we had to wait for the other residents to finish We requested a late check out before arrival as booking com gave us this option We did not receive any reply When we asked at the reception desk we were told that there was no availability unless we paid another 10 pounds per hour It seems that if you pay there is availability if you don t pay the hotel is fully booked,0

We were told we got upgraded on arrival to the Eiffel tower view room wow great In we go into the smallest elevator ever 2people max to the top floor The room was tiny but yes the balcony did have a view of the Eiffel tower for what that was worth What they failed to tell us also was that one of the shower panels was completely missing I mean if we turned on the shower the water had nowhere else to go but all over the bathroom floor Crazy We informed reception and were given a different room which turned out to be twice the size of our upgraded room and we could still see the Eiffel tower from the balcony So much for upgrades,0

It was the worst experience I reached there 12 am as scheduled but the reception staff informed us that there is no room available due to boiler problem They have waited till we reached the hotel to inform us that there is no room They never contacted us or phoned to say anything Moreover they have send us with a taxi to a horrible hotel with nasty smell and noisy AC which we couldn t use to heat the room so It ended up with a tiny electric heater beside the bed,0

 The bathroom was very nice and well kept The male staff were very helpful at front desk at night and so were the general staff that helped carry your luggage they were very kind and helpful however there was a down side to the staff as they were let down by one female member of staff who I thought was quite rude in her mannerisms and the way she spoke and definitely needs to either try and enjoy her job or find a new one honestly working can be crap and boring but get over it we all have to work However not to discourage the other female receptionist who checked us out as she was very helpful and friendly ,1
Been to this hotel several times before its our favourite place to stay on London The hotel is an old terrace building with beautiful iron work details on the exteriors and gorgeous mahogany staircases and marble fireplaces The breakfast is of an excellent quality and has fantastic choice from full english buffet to cheese salad and salmon as well as continental selection The staff are always well presented polite and service is exceptional It is a short 3 4 minute walk from Queensway tube station Central Line so is perfectly lovated next to Hyde Park and is close the Oxford St Hammersmith and Shepherds Bush as well as Notting Hill Westminister is less than 15 mins away via the tube Queensway tube station has 1 small set of stairs to and from the platform to the upper floor then there is a lift to the ticket hall So if you have luggage its not too many stairs to lift your cases,1

 incredible exterior best location,1
The room was tiny To put this into perspective we are two 30 yr old females who have travelled quite a bit and have used various standards of accomadation from hostels upwards so it s not like we re accustomed to luxury I ve also been in London a number of times so I understand hotel rooms are small in general Knowing this we paid a bit extra for a deluxe double as it was supposed to have more room but the bed was a standard double in size and there was only bare walking room on one side and at the end and you could just about stand on the other side of it We actually found it massively amusing trying to figure out what was deluxe about the room,0
 Bed was very comfortable really enjoyed the nice powerful and warm shower The media facilities were top notch the ability to use a HDMI socket in the room is a great touch ,1
 For the cost the rooms are small compared to North America But bigger here than what you will find at hotels elsewhere Staff were exceptional ,0

 Service at the bar we had to wait quite long to get served even tough there were only a few other guests at the bar Variety of the buffet was a little poor for a continental breakfast ,0
 Location was great,1
I booked for 6 nights instead of 5 I contacted them within 5 minutes of the booking but as it was a special deal they refused to amend the booking even though I contacted them straight way The built in panelling in the room was a bit dated and made it very narrow and difficult to get around the end of the bed,0
 The way we were checked in by Mariah giving us a good room and making our wedding anniversary so special ,1
 Very small room noisy from above because of very creaky floorboards Difficult drop off but mainly because of roadworks Nearby parking costs reasonable for London No restaurant in hotel for dinner ,0
 The room is way too small No matter how well appointed it is nothing the hotel does can make up for the fact that this feels like a rip off every single moment Barely any elbow room ,0
 Beautiful location next to park,1
 Terrible noise all through the night,0

 No wifi signal First time room was tiny Spoke to reception moved to bigger room Tap in the bathroom doesn t work properly,0
 Room was not ready for us to check in The front desk staff who dealt with us were cold and impersonal No sense of personal individualised service ,0

 The room was really completely sound proof We appreciated the bathroom with both tube and big shower cabin together with the super cozy bath ropes And if you like to listen to music properly don t forget to bring a little audio cable jack to jack The superior rooms are equipped with a Bose sound system but it doesn t have a bluethooth connection and you will need this cable ,1
Location was 5 min walk from Paddington,1
 It is beautiful looking hotel fantastic staircase comfortable bar lounge The staff were all really pleasant and helpful from the minute we arrived at reception to collecting our bags when leaving ,1
 Very convenient location for Earl s Court Tube station Warm welcome from reception staff Good breakfast with plenty of choice bacon was crisp and tasty not like far too many restaurants who offer limp boiled bacon ,1
No Negative,0
 There was no parking available at the hotel which isn t a huge deal but having parking is always a bonus The staff was really great and helped us find a good car park about a five minute walk away The view from our room was not great we faced Waterloo Station but I m sure the other side of the hotel could see the London Eye The bar staff and the breakfast staff seemed a little preoccupied and we had some trouble flagging someone down but the drinks were good and pretty reasonable at the bar and the management was usually pretty good at noticing things and trying to adjust ,0
 Beautiful room friendly staff and an amazing view of the Arc de Triomphe Well placed for attractions in Paris close to the metro and within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower ,1
 position,0
 I generally do not eat breakfast in the hotel partly because Carluccio s is close at hand and I am more interested in Italian cuisine than a more conservative English hotel cuisine I hesitate to say that I am unhappy with the dining room or the bar because the hotel is so wonderful in other respects Nevertheless these might be the only parts of the Russell that would benefit from change That being said however few hotels manage change successfully and I would hate to see the Russell lose its undoubted charm ,0

 Room was so small and bathroom was even smaller Showering resulted in everything in sight being drenched no workable shower screen and pathetic shower headlike ,0
 We upgraded to a larger room Had the bath infront of the bed which allowed us to relax before having the best nights sleep I ve probably ever had due to the comfort of the beds ,1

 Bar staff very friendly and prices reasonable for the area,1
 The couch in the room was broken so you couldn t sit and chill,0
 The room was spotless but very small I would have liked it to be a larger room for the rate The Hilton up the road was a similar rate for a much larger room The staff were vet friendly and helpful ,1
 Old style slightly costy,0
 The self laundry service is a saver for family with children And health club spa service is fantastic but quite expensive Should make it bit economical ,1
 Room on this occassion was a bit small Yoo much furniture in it step very near bed to bathroom could easily fall Would req larger room next time bathroom is small Bath very deep can b awkward to get in to ,0

When I arrived we got given a little card for a free drink for each of us due to it being under construction disappointed in the fact that before I booked it they never mentioned anything about having work done All the lovely garden had been tourn up Then the next morning I got rudely awakened at 6 45 7 00 by work men banging this went on for a good hour or so That s probably why I wouldn t stay at hotel arena again I was disgusted by that and the fact they don t do full English breakfasts,0
No Positive,1
However the way to that about 10 minutes walks isn t the most pleasure one with some poor families living under the bridge in front of the hotel My family and I didn t had any problem but you you have concerns with security I don t recomend,0

 Room wasn t ready and had to wait for it ,0
 Breakfast location metroconnection to airport and not far from the centre Ok,1

 Lovely clean hotel in a great location Staff were very friendly and helpful and keen to ensure we had the best possible stay The room was immaculate and well equipped ,1
 Heating wasn t working which took two visits from the technicians to sort out in the space of four and a half hours ,0
 Building work during the day but this can t be helped ,0
 The cost was a bit too expensive but considering the location I ll make an exception The noise of people opening and closing doors was immense Also the sound of water running through the pipes from upstairs was very loud It was evident everytime someone flushed the toilet The sound proofing needs a bit of work to say the least Lack of USB chargers in a modern hotel is questionable ,0
 The shower didnt have a door so the floor got wet,0
We had late night drinks and noticed all others had complimentary nibbles We didn t get any and over 10 for 2 beers it would have been appreciated,0

A picture is worth a thousand words Added photos are not taken from a construction site this is central London and what you see through your window if you can after paying about 200euros per night in a 4 star hotel not like the amazing photos on the website right Needless to say the view is accompanied by construction noises starting at 7 30 am in the working days Sure they do have double glazed glasses but I am a very light sleeper and requested an upper storey room for this reason in my reservation Seems no one reads or cares what is written there In the room there was no coffee machine as declared on the booking com website the hot water pressure was so low that a quick shower took ages Housekeepers knocked our door two times by mistake as they thought we need additional sheets or a sofa bed After all yes the room was clean excluding the muddy windows and spacious but the rest was enough to ruin our anniversary We will never step in Park Plaza again even if it is the only hotel in town and I will make sure that this outstanding quality will be seen and known by as many as other people so that same cannot happen to them,0
 We stayed in an executive suite and it was very nice Water pressure was great in the shower a big plus in my book and the sofa bed was very comfortable Also the property was very clean and every staff member we had contact with was friendly and helpful Great stay overall I would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone who wants to be close to the Westminster area and or plans to do much day tripping as Waterloo Station will connect you with just about anywhere you want to go ,1
Size of room for 3people and excellent location close to Hyde park,1
 The public areas were very grand but our room was a little worn the windows were filthy there were lights missing and the bathroom floor was not entirely clean ,0
 Stair case needs upgrading to match the rest of the hotel,0
 A very good hotel Comfortable bed nice shower and over all a clean and a very nice room Friendly staff ,1
Room had been made smaller what it should havebin Not enough room for clothes No bedside cabinets not much room to pass at the bottom of bed Not very good for 4 star,0
 The room looked straight onto an office window so was a little obtrusive But understand I wasn t paying for a view ,0
 I booked this hotel because of the architecture of the actual building and the price was ok The building was beautiful ,1
 Location and modern comfort eg design of room and free phone with apps ,1
 Perfect setting perfect customer service perfect position ,1
Room small disappointing with the double bed pressed to one wall water serving bath and shower sink was luke warm not hot Whilst compared to other clients 175 for our small room with no breakfast was clearly a cheap offering by comparison to others available the 4 stars should relate to all rooms not just how impressive the lobby staircase are,0
 It will be nice when the furniture up grades are completed,0
The staff were very unfriendly in both the reception area and the restaurant we booked a twin room for our 3 night stay and when we checked in there was no twin room available and we had to take 2 small single rooms No apology I emailed 4 times about my booking no response I rang the hotel 3 times as my flight was delayed no answer We paid for the room on check in and when we went to check out they insisted that we didn t pay and had to find the card receipt to prove we had paid when we gave it to the receptionist we got no apology again and were not asked if we enjoyed our stay I would not stay at this hotel again,0
 everything was very close few minutes walking and you were in the middle of everything the staff were very kind they would not let you go out in the rain without an umbrella was very clean room was huge beds super comfy food on point the doormen were very friendly and made you fell welcome was like a home away from home would highly recommend to everyone AMAZBALLS xoxo gossip girl,1

Unfortunately I got a room next to the kitchen extractor fan which was VERY noisy Room 247 by the way The first night it stopped at 11 p m so that was all right but the second night it did not so I hardly slept at all However when I mentioned this at checking out I was compensated with having my breakfasts taken off the bill and promised a free upgrade next time I come so I ended up feeling more pleased than I had thought I would be I have stayed at the Russell several times before After my sleepless night I thought this was the last time but because of the way my complaint was dealt with I will certainly return,0

First night I was put in a basement room with no signal not ideal when you re trying to work in the evening They moved me for the 2nd night and the TV didn t work for the majority of the evening,0
This is not a 4 star hotel in my opinion decor is worn out in places toilets in the main enterance for example where wood was exposed on the skirting breakfast although very nice was too pricy 14 99 Room small they call it boutique but really it is just small The room we had had an enterance hall which was good for storing buggy ect but given that it was a room for a family with a baby access was on the first floor via a lift then we had to go down a flight of stairs to get to the door to our room No bt sport in room or bar so unable to watch a big champions leaugue match surely a 4 star hotel can afford to provide this for guests,0

 Amazing views and service from all staff,1
 Our room was in the attic I think It was very small indeed However we didn t explore other options and it was cheap so we don t take it personally Room a little tired and should really be sold as a single ,0
 The hotel could do with looking at second glazing Poor fitting window very loud traffic sounds at night thus couldnot sleep very well ,0
 Very small bathroom ,0
Rooms are not heated may be an issue in very cold winters Gym is open from 4 00 pm to 10 00pm when you usually are out,0
They assign you a different room then you reserved and lie in your face that it s the same one Insects on on bedclothes They give you one towel for two guests The air conditioning was going crazy loud every 15 minutes during the night The room is so small it s hard to walk,0
 Nothing at all,0
 I like the location and probably the staff was trying to assist to accommodate mi in the hotel when three floor was out of order,1
the main bed was great the opened sofa terrible hard uneven small lucky for us the 180cm male can sleep almost everywhere but this will not fit 2 persons or any type of a princess,0

 My requirements were ignored leaving my travel companion staying in the room I booked but given the light respiratory health issues allergies the bathroom smelling of cigarettes and the room being cramped left me with the an option not to stay at this hotel Did not want to go through the frustrating conversations at reception but would not stay again Definitely not value for money paid given the room on a ground floor where you can barely move around in and a smell of cigarettes in the bathroom ,0
 The staff is frindey ,1
 Dreadful staff who would not help despite their booking process being unclear They need the card you book the room under to be present at check in which is useless for corporate bookings They will not take card payment over the phone or web because of fraud but would be happy to take a payment from the same card if you didn t turn up Happy to leave two guests waiting in reception with no access to room whilst this was resolved Really bad experience won t be booking again They also want to photocopy your driving license and bank card and try to tell you that you have to sign up to their loyalty club ,0
Rooms can do with some TLC and are much smaller than anticipated Room 517 was quite warm and the split system would blow warm when placed on cool and cool when placed on warm Bathroom ventilation is poor also Cleaning staff half heartedly serviced our room on two occasions If you need a Taxi do not use the hotels affiliate service They will rip off any unnasuming tourist 20 for a four minute car journey I don t think so,0
 The ambience,1
Location was great 10 min walk from underground 20 min walk from Leicester Square Comfortable room nice staff well priced,1
 Front of room breakfast staff woman was very rude to us The scrambled eggs did not taste good at all Very buttery and watery ,0
 Great location Also had guest laundry which is fabulous for those travelling for a few weeks ,1
 The photos are enhanced on the Internet as in reality the hotel is very very dark inside and if I m honest a bit dreary From outside it looks really poor and needs a paint and clean of Windows It needs sensitively being freshened up throughout The decor is not consistent so a bit hit and miss Bedrooms modern but not comfy beds or pillows sadly Perhaps we had the smaller type room and should have upgraded We had very little space in ours that a glass fell from the bedside table and smashed as you could not move freely I wouldnt stay again ,0

 I booked using this site and I admit it was a little last minute however my savings via the website weren t showing up on their systems and they were going to take the full price at first In my case they were quick to resolve the issue however it took much longer to resolve the same problem for my colleagues Also their system tried to take money from my card even after I had paid for my whole stay Be vigilant and check your card now and then during your stay ,0

 The hotel has seen better days The d cor generally was tired Various fittings in the room were in need of repair notably the table which wasn t level and the sink tap which bled black bits after use The room also stank of smoke which got worse when the a c was turned on The staff were generally uninterested On early arrival I asked if I could have access to the room to get changed as I had cut my leg while travelling I wished to dress the cut and change any clothing which had blood on it Two of the three staff members I asked were perplexed by the question despite being able to see the injury The third staff member offered me a Band Aid and use of the ladies toilets Its not easy trying to open a suitcase in a cubicle Five minutes in the room or any room and I would have felt a good deal better disposed towards the venue I particularly didn t like the attitude of the duty manager when we checked out and raised the issue of the faults in the room He implied it was our problem for putting up with it but on past performance ie the lack of effort while I m standing at reception bleeding I wasn t hopeful that anything would have happened I further was not impressed by the implication in pre arrival emails that the hotel was going to upgrade us as it was a celebration stay They didn T Instead they gave us one slice of an inedible lemon cheesecake I remain unimpressed as the promised follow up from the hotel regarding our concerns hasn t happened Breakfast was average Service remained indifferent Not what I expect from a four star hotel I wouldn t recommend or return to it ,0
 The location was great near the main attractions but nice and quite The staff was more than helpful ,1
 The room it was fairly small It wasn t a problem for us as we spent very little time in the room but it was rather compact and may be a problem for those who need to use the room longer than we did ,0

 The location of this hotel is horrible When we took the bus to the station it kept going to a bad neighborhood This hotel is located near a bridge where it is full of refugees and homeless people around When we got off the train people kept staring at us and smelled like someone peed the whole time when we walked to the hotel from the station We felt very insecure Staffs were okay but I feel that they can be more helpful to those who are traveling Few of them were just lazy with their answers Also They don t really smile ,0
 Comfort of the beds high ceilings and black out curtains travel phone and interior,1
 The Hotel is a grand old building and this quirkyness has been retained The staff were very helpful The rooms clean and beds comfortable,1
Very little space in the room Bathroom was tiny Was unable to enter bathroom after having a shower due to wet room style shower which caused the floor to be very wet for a number of hours after Air conditioning unit made screeching noises when turned off or low fan And humming noise was constant when turned on Also if temperature was set at less than 20C the unit was extremely noisy Had to walk sideways to get from one side of room to the opposite side due to the position of the bed being so close to the end wall of the room,0
 The hotel facilities are good and i enjoy their breakfast ,1

 I have never stayed in this hotel before It was easy to get yourself lost in Westminster Borough and so had rang the hotel reception for directions and had the whole time to hold the phone on me till I have eventually have found the destination It made my life so much easier as I ve never been around in this part of London before When I walked in to the main entrance I was nicely greeted by the doorman and had immediately carried my luggage all the way to my room My club room was BEAUTIFUL but the only disadvantage was it didn t had a big window as expected as shown on the gallery It didn t fuss me much though The cleanliness of the room was at such high standards and was very impressed with the size of the shower head as it was ENORMOUS I had no problem with the room and had provided me with a plateful of fresh fruit wrapped in clingfilm and two bottles of Merlot Never to late to drink on your arrival why not The best part of the hotel was the breakfast I didn t like the breakfast I absolutely LOVED it as it was the BEST breakfast EVER Everything was cooked to perfection nicely smoked the juices were freshly pressed and a big thank you to the chef for all of his cooking efforts The restaurant staff had welcomed me with a very cheery attitude and had made me felt at home They were so lovely and I felt very accomplished To half of those negative reviewers coming up with such sad enthusiastic comments think again because from my point of view this hotel deserves more than a four star Well done to all and be prepared for my next visit Xx,1

The hotel location is excellent and the building is stunning inside and out The staff were accommodating and very pleasant as always The breakfast special offer was also a good bonus plus the fact we could leave our luggage with the concierge as our room wasn t ready and we didn t return until 11 30 was a real comfort It was lovely to be able to sit in the bar with a glass of wine and unwind after a very hectic day,1

 The grubsrew that secures the tap faucet to the Tap mixer unit was missing and was only discovered to be missing when the tap was used and water pressure then pushed the faucet off the mixer tap base this was reported to reception on Sat Sun and Monday morning still no fix before check out amusing the first time you flood the bathroom and take a cold shower More amusing when the second time it is not you who gets wet Definitely not amusing when it happens a third time because maintenance cannot fix the faucet only push it back on ,0

 We chose this expensive hotel because the photos on Booking com seemed to show a rooftop restaurant with views over London and were really looking forward to sitting there in the evening for a meal When we arrived we were told there was no such roof restaurant although they admitted they had previously had other guests who had expected the same The restaurant was indoors on the ground floor and adjoining courtyard on the ground floor The photos we had seen were of the terrace of one of the penthouse suites showing tables chairs and food We were really disappointed and felt the advertising had been misleading ,0

 As previous reviewers have said the rooms are very small but for London this is probably typical Upgrading to a Club room provides access to the Club Lounge which has seating areas computers and a coffee tea station Breakfast is a bit pricey as we were able to walk around the corner to a great little cafe and have a wonderful breakfast for half the price ,0

Paid extra 35 for upgrade as my wife birthday Room was large but refurb above caused a lot of noise at 8am and double glazing had 1inch gap so road noise was extreme After complaining when checking out manager offered 15 refund I complained we shouldn t have been given that room no response Also on first floor the metro can be clearly heard at 5am choose your room carefully,0

 Very small inward facing room with very small bathroom Expensive for this accommodation ,0
 Booking com advertised my room as having a bath however it didn t The TV didn t work meaning the wifi didn t work Advised staff of both issues and received no offer of resolution Acted as though because it was a last minute booking due to Eurostar cancellation that it was my problem and I should just make do Very sub standard,0

 The breakfast was too widely spread it took a while to realise how much choice there was,0

 We love the Park Plaza County Hall because it is so convenient to everything London It is close to Parliament Westminster Abbey and the Eye We love the close pubs and restaurants The train station is two blocks away ,1
My 4th but now final stay at the Park Plaza County Hall What has previously been a fine hotel has descended below all expectations 4 night stay in a Studio King Family with plenty of issues 1 Studio King is a lie there is no king bed and reception cheerfully laughed off my complaint on the first day that this was a mis representation 2 Lifts during high occupancy average morning wait on the first floor 10 15mins The lift simply prioritises higher floors every time Yes there are stairs but with a 7 month pregnant wife I shouldn t have to rely on them 3 Breakfast again during high occupancy a disgrace 10 15 mins average wait for a table 4 Temperature control in the room does not work bedroom was a sauna whilst living area was cool 5 Shower Water pressure poor and shower head not properly cleaned with lots of outlets blocked with scum 6 Concierge on checking out did not help with luggage from room despite request link this to pregnant wife and useless lifts after waiting 15 mins I had to carry luggage down stairs with multiple trips as my waiting airport transfer was charging for exceeding permitted waiting time 7 Lobby bar is a nice area providing good value and options of f b but suffered from being too close to the entrance and so was very cold with a constant breeze from people coming and going from the hotel All in all an absolute joke yes I understand hotels struggle during high occupancy but this was simply unacceptable at the rate charged and service expectation What was my go to Central London hotel is now a NEVER AGAIN hotel,0
 Really handy for the tube Always very clean and probably the comfiest beds I ve slept in ,1

 The whole place including staff were so extremely lovely and helpful and just generally amazing There isn t one thing I can say against the place Brilliant ,1
 Convenient location next to my office at walking distance Quiet street but near many restaurants Indian owned hotel with Indian chef in kitchen ,1
 pillows smells like french fries but bed was so comfortable ,1
 A single room allocated on first night for two persons was not acceptable The price of breakfast was too high as we did not have the cooked meal ,0
Booked a Club room when we arrived the room was under the Main Street and didn t even have any windows Hardly 4 Star and what you expect from a Club Room then we asked to be moved in the second room we didn t receive the complimentary Dressing Gowns 2 Bottles of Wine or fruit platter that you were suppose to get with a Club Room Also when going to shower ready for the theatre at 1600 there was no hot water which meant us having to have a freezing cold shower The Club Room Bar they advertise is actually the only bar and the same as everyone else you just go through a different door to get to it with the label Club Lounge on it and we got charged for everything we had in there so don t see the point in having it or the difference in what you get for paying for a better room Tottlag a waste of good money spent,0
 The staff were excellent particularly the Night Manager who handled a breakdown in our bathroom really well in the end relocating us to a different hotel with the same chain and providing complimentary airport transfers Very pleased with the service ,1
 Customized attention Very good beds,1
 upgraded our room went out of their way to quickly check us in The restaurant was a pleasant surprise very good food and service ,1
 The hotel is really nice and the location is perfect The staff was not as good and quick that I would have desired,1
 The continual noise from the air conditioning heating fans outside and the loud beats of music from a party evening both making it difficult to get to sleep ,0
 We had more than a little trouble with a window right next to the bed that we couldn t get closed which caused a very uncomfortable draft in my small room The concierge tried helping and we put in a request for maintenance but it was two windows causing the issue They fixed one the second night but not the other ,0

 Close to paddington good accomodation with marvelous breakfast ,1
 The staff were really attentive to their guests ,1
The room was so tiny we could hardly believe it even after an upgrade to a bigger room It was smaller than our bedroom at home The view from our room overlooked a backstreet loading bay for a nearby restaurant takeaway which instantly took the edge off having a room upgrade I couldn t help thinking what view we would have had from the smaller room The pictures online of the reception lounge area are bang on it looks lovely however the rooms are nowhere near what is shown The advertised rooms must cost an absolute fortune I ve spent over 100 less per night in London for bigger rooms better views and the same facilities The overall experience nowhere near justifies the cost,0
24 reception Changed rooms immediately after complaint,1
 Comfortable bed Good location Quiet area Even biscuits in the room as well as usual tea and coffee ,1
 Very close to major sites and great cafes Quiet at night as well being in the location that it is in ,1
 Nothing comes to mind ,0
 No privacy The staff can come in any time although you lock the room from inside I found that quite shocking Never seen anything like this in my life The staff will knock but will NOT wait long enough They just barge in Also the wardrobes are a mockery of the word The layout of things in the room is quite awkward i e location of the kettle power charging points the so called wardrobes everything is at user un friendly location in the room ,0
in spite of the environmental friendly policy our towels were exchanged on the 2nd day although we had not dropped them on the floor which is an unnecessary waste of resources,0
 Staff made our stay extra special as they knew it was a Birthday weekend break Excellent room food service ,1

 The hotel only support to call their contracted taxi which is expensive and unsafe when we paid by credit card they have no cashier mashine in the car instead they called the back office we had to tell them our credit card no expire month and the security no through the mobile phone this is very riskful for us The hotel should improve their taxi service raise the safety requirement to their contracted taxi company ,0

 Very handy location to Paddington Station and Heathrow Express and in the pretty Paddington area This hotel is clean and comfortable if a little dated The staff are wonderful thank you And the English breakfast was excellent Not a fancy and extensive breakfast buffet but a tasty and well cooked meal Equally food on the room service menu was tasty and fresh Good Indian and European cuisine ,1
Had stayed at the hotel a few years ago had a beautiful large room very disappointed with my return visit At 340 for our 2 night stay I didn t expect to get the smallest hotel room I have ever been in was amazed that they managed to shoehorn a bathroom into the space they had There was a bath too I am only 5 feet tall and I couldn t lie down in the bath a good shower stall would have made much more sense The bed was comfortable Everything looked pretty shabby the windows were very dirty didn t matter that much the only view we had was of a white tiled dirty wall Will not return here,0
 Whole experience added to our fantastic adventure,1
 the small balcony overlooking the arch and the metro station which is right outside the hotel entrance,1
 Manager instantly sorted a problem for us which meant we had an excellent stay ,1

 Location wise very accessible to public transport near hyde park kensington park The Staff were all accommodating The hotel itself tells a lot of History Breakfast buffet is excellent ,1
We had a up grade to bigger room was wandering how big our other room was as up grade wasn t big at all also the decor needed up dating and repainting of doors especial bathroom which need a bit of gloss on it so it could be wiped in 516 also we reserved room with one debit card and wanted to pay with another but 2 days before we arrived they took money out of account which made me over drawn and then when we checked in they wanted payment for room so we payed with another card and was told it would take 5 days to process my refund on to original card this actually take longer than a cheque clearing so they had two amounts of money for one night stay not happy about this,0
 The room was incredibly small very disappointing No room for suit cases no table or chairs My dog has a larger kennel ,0
 Modern hotel good staff and excellent value for money with a very good lounge offering drinks and snacks ,1

I paid for an executive suite with city view as it stated on the website What I got was a room on the 11 th floor overlooking the side of the Park Plaza Westminster across the road and part of the construction site from Waterloo train station Very unhappy about this I was told at reception I could look forward to a great view from my room the windows were filthy to so good luck taking any photos of your stunning view James quirk,0

When we checked in at the given time of 2pm our room was unavailable and would be told we would have to wait in another smaller room for 1 hour 3 hours later our room was still unavailable Due to having plans my husband 20 year old daughter and I had to get ready and prepared for our night out in a very small room We then had to leave our belongings with the staff who said they would put our things in our room when it was available Fair enough our belongings were in our booked room when we returned to the hotel 4 hours later however we found this very unsettling There was no sofa double bed pull out in the room like there was shown in photos there was a tiny bed set up with a very thin mattress which my daughter said was uncomfortable,0
 I booked online for my parents and called the hotel with a couple of requests The receptionist was very helpful and professional The booking and payment went very smoothly My parents said that they loved the hotel and that the room was very nice They also loved the breakfast and booked it for the entire stay ,1

Very tricky getting a reasonable gluten free breakfast despite putting it in the details and phoning ahead Took 3 attempts to get something and several incorrect rounds of information being given despite a 3 year old being coeliac and waiting patiently for his gluten free food Balcony was lovely but it appeared to be the only one missing outside seating which is a missed opportunity given the view Room was a little tired and worn decor wise but a fab size,0

They purposely not allowed my parents to check in one hour earlier since the room was ready The reason I wanted to check in earlier because my parents took a 15hours flight and need to take a rest before going out but the lady said the hotel policy stated check in time is at 3pm but before that she kept on allowing other customer non asian customer to check in I FELT DISCRIMINATED,0

The location is very good only 5min stroll to paddington tube The staff were very friendly helpful The room was spotlessly clean very warm with beautiful furnishings The wine fruit was a lovely touch,1
 Location style price,1
 the room was quite small and the windows not insulated so outside noise and cold air were factors,0
 Very friendly staff and good supply of toiletries in the room ,1
 I say this after every visit but please put tea and coffee making facilities in every room and an iron Very cheap B and Bs do this so why not an exclusive hotel ,0

 The room had no windows which I know the hotel had no choice on but still did feel a bit suffocating Small issue though not a deal breaker And if they could only find a way to fit a mini bar in the room ,0
 Nothing,0
 I was dissatisfied with the fact that the shower floor was not sectioned off from the main bathroom floor There was no difference between the shower floor and bathroom floor so to speak ,0
Double room was small and in need of a freshen up Also woken up a 5am when a noisy generator fired up outside our room this may have something to do with all the building work that is going on at the hotel but when you have had a late night that s the last thing you want,0
No Negative,0
 the remote control for the TV needed replacing as you couldn t see the details ,0
 Breakfast was horribly overpriced We were offered option for reduced rate of we bought breakfast every morn of our visit but we couldn t do this because we had to leave early the day we departed ,0

 leaky shower,0
Room and in particular the bathroom is a tight squeeze for 2 people and from this perspective I don t think the hotel offers good value for money We also experienced extremely poor service at the Arches Bar which given that we were out celebrating a special occasion affected our evening and would be enough to say we wont be returning,0
 Breakfast was very nice and the staff were so helpful especially with giving us advice on transport around the city Also the bed was comfortable so we slept so well each night ,1
 Pleased with the complimentary breakfasts probably should be included for the price ,1
Rude reception staff at check in Rooms were not ready and we had to wait in one room for 45 mins then when we enquirer where our other 2 rooms were going to be ready we were told not yet when we were eventually given our rooms they were not fully serviced and once used the key card would not work but apart from the check in the hotel was great,0

 Wonderful staff So switched on and so genuinely helpful and concerned about pleasing guests,1
 Everything it s amazing,1
 They overbooked the hotel when we arrived there was a large gap under the door which made us feel the room was lacking in privacy the bathroom was actually caked in dust under the sink I saw this because I dropped a soap The shower didn t have a curtain or screen so water gushed everywhere the shower head also didn t stay in place everything about the place felt cheap and budget the rooms are tiny and it felt unclean I would have rather stayed in a holiday inn or premier inn worst hotel I ve ever stayed at ,0
 Location and staff excellent and very quiet,1
 Nearly everything ,1
 May be the Restaurant Bar must extend the close hours ,0
I wanted to give another guarantee card than the one I had prepaid with and the guy at the desk was new and demanded that I repay my booking with the new card Which I did and they reimbursed me on the initial card but I suffered a foreign exchange supplementary cost of 15,0

 Breakfast ,1
 location good rooms,1
 The hotel is in a very convenient location for Central London and was great value for money Our booking was made at a very reasonable rate and we just wanted rooms for one night but they were also able to give us rooms with baths on a special request ,1
 I asked for a quiet room and I only heard one siren but the outlook over the dumpsters wasn t spectacular It was a surprise to receive half a bottle of wine don t like Merlot so my friend enjoyed it but the thought was nice ,1
 The bathrooms only had smoked glass walls which did not provide as much privacy as we are used to The lighting in the halls was too dim ,0
 the room was tiny no cupboards to hang clothes and had issues paying before arrival ,0

Had to wait 3 hours for our room Ordered delivery and had to go downstairs in my pajamas to get it The shower water overflowed into the kitchenette area and then all the way into the bedroom Our entire room was soaked The room was freezing the entire time despite the heat being on the maximum level,0
 Although the room was a bit small but for Paris standards it was fine we were very comfortable The room was clean with a very comfortable bed and a nice bathroom The breakfast was also great Fresh squeezed orange juice hot food French pastries bread and more We have nothing but praise for this hotel ,1

 disappointed that our upgrade did not live up to expectations of pictures on the invitation email which I suspect were from a different hotel altogether This was misleading The suite was very noisy with traffic on the road outside and noise from the stair well just outside the door I felt this was poor value for the additional money spent ,0
 Room was a little hot No fan available,0

 We have stayed at Apex before amazing hotel staff comfort and rooms ,1
 The sofa bed was uncomfortable,0
 Extremely friendly and helpful staff Room was fantastic with its view of the effiel tower and always very clean Easy to walk from hotel to all major attractions and very close to subway if you don t want to walk We had a great long weekend away would come back again ,1
 Slow lifts even away from busy breakfast times,0
 free wifi lovely heritage building good location for walking to shopping on bus route and close to underground Concierge didn t even offer to take bags to room on arrival or assist with carrying up the fairly steep entrance stairs interior could do with a refreshment of decor to fit the outside heritage appearance ,1
 Quiet area,1
 Breakfast tables toooo close,0
 Service horrible Pillows super stiff and big could break your neck Room service was done they removed the towels and did not leave us with anything Door was not closing and found out on second day that it can be easily opened Service in general was poor I would not stay here,0
 I had asked at time of booking that the room be feather free especially bedding as feathers trigger my husband s asthma This was not done and so we had to ask again at reception and then wait for someone to swap the bedding Overall staff seemed too busy ,0
 The room was very small and it needs refurbishing,0
Small beds Premier Inn is ahead of most hotel chains on this front Also cost of a glass of wine at 10 for a relatively basic Malbec was a bit steep but they have to make their money back somewhere,0
 Location for me but it is still very central ,0
 First got given a room without a bath but immediately changed upon request,0

 Quite place,1
 Great Location good Value for Money,1
 No fresh air No ability to open any kind of window It was very warm on our stay and it felt claustrophobic I appreciate we were on a high floor but maybe a smaller window that would allow some fresh air in would have been good ,0
Would have been courteous to have been told that building work was going on Bar staff wearing jeans and trainers is not in keeping with 4 hotel Having to ask every day for milk for tea making in room Having to ask for towels that were not left in the room Room 304 no shelf in the shower for putting shampoo razor etc,0
Very clean hotel to the point of sparkling Comfortable standard club room with tea making Great location for major sighs but out of the hustle and bustle of the west end Hop on the bus hail a cab or walk 20mins to get almost anywhere,1

We booked a standard room six months before with the idea that we would be allocated a good one However we were given one on the 6th floor with a tiny wardrobe small windows facing into a quadrangle and an even smaller washbasin As this was for our 50th wedding anniversary we were very upset and complained The response was excellent and the replacement standard room was so much better Management gave us a bottle of champagne and a cake to celebrate our anniversary Pity we had to complain though,0

 We booked this hotel on its location but due to road closers it took us along time to get to the other side of the river,0
 The Club Room was located in the basement with virtually no natural light The cafe restaurant was right next door to the room with grease odours permeating throughout the room The tiny room was decorated in dark stained chipboard and it looked as if it hadn t been decorated in years The room they moved us to the next day was better only as it was lighter Don t believe the pictures on the website The staff were clearly not trained in basic customer service as they had little knowledge of solving even the basic of issues and found it difficult to hide their annoyance when I had the ordacity to complain ,0

 The room was very difficult to access within the building which consists of townhouses that have been remodeled as a hotel We had to go up an elevator up some stairs down some others and it was confusing long and very difficult to handle with our heavy bags Thankfully the staff is attentive and responsive and there to help with luggage Another issue was that while the bed and room was clean the window was very dirty The window was also small due to the location of the room within the building ,0

 I like everything about the Intercontinental hotel was very comfortable during my stay Nice nd helpful staff ,1
 Location was terrible the area was unclean and smelled terrible And in front of the hotel there was a site area for homeless people This made the area very unsafe to walk through especially at night Breakfast was basic to say the least not many options hardly any vege options Hotel staff were not very accommodating to any requests and when something was missing in the room due to poor room service i e No tea bags or no milk or no cups no soap the hotel expected you to come to reception to collect the missing items rather than bring them to the room ,0

 We didn t get a room on our first night apparently there was a problem with the boiler so we had to go to a sister hotel called the Metropolitan hotel This was very inconveniant given that we lost a lot of time getting there and returning the next day In addition we didn t even know where they would bring us to even though we had to pay for the whole duration of our stay upon arrival at the Grand Royale The sister hotel did not meet our expectations either When we returned to the Grand Royale the following day we had to wait again in order to get our room All in all we lost a lot of time waiting around which was quite annoying given that we only stayed in London for two nights ,0
 Room was adequate for one night stay clean and quiet Breakfast nice eggs cooked to order ,1
This is an amazing hotel we first went in Jan 2015 for a six night break and loved it so much that we went in Jan 2016 for five nights The staff are very helpful and there are always plenty around The location is fantastic just a few minutes walk to the Strand and about 20 mins to Oxford Street The rooms are well appointed and comfortable and the wifi works well and allows multiple devices to be logged on We like this hotel so much that we are now thinking about one of the Apex Edinburgh hotels for the end of Feb,1
Stayed in room 226 Comfy bed and pillows Quiet room facing lovely garden Super clean and neat Good size flat screen TV with lots of channels Staff wonderfully helpful Food in bar restaurant really good and priced on par with other sit down table service restaurants Two minute walk from Earl s Court Tube Also every convenience a traveler could want located right on Earl s Court Road several bank ATMs pubs and other eateries laundry dry cleaning services even America fast food if you need your fix McDonald s Burger King KFC and Starbucks There s even a retractable clothes line in the shower for those travelers like me who do a bit of sink laundry I always remind my fellow Americans who are not used to European hotel rooms that rooms are small compared to US standards but comfort cleanliness and location rank FAR higher in my opinion than wasted floor space,1

We booked a 3 night stay in a suite On arrival the room was tidy but not clean paint falling of the walls in a couple of places During the first night we were woken up by an intruder to the room at 0630 I went to the reception to investigate and explain what had happened It turned out to be the night cleaner who had no business coming in our room He came to apologise with a feeble excuse I tripped and fell into the door We didn t buy it and asked for a full refund credit where credit is due the manager gave it to us I asked her to remove my credit card from the room security deposit to which she assured me it was We went to a far better hotel and thought the matter was done with No it wasn t I came home to find my credit card had been charged 420 from them I phoned them up to complain and the money was returned However I have lost about 30 in bank charges due to their incompetence Terrible experience in what is essentially a hostel,0
 Breakfast was average There were a lot of staff working at breakfast time but trying to order poached eggs from a member of staff proved a challenge each morning The lunch here is poor and very expensive If you are to stay here best to eat elsewhere ,0

We were unable to check in when we arrived and had to wait until half 2 by which time we were off to the ballet and did not arrive back at the hotel until 6 o clock However being the weekend before Christmas I can understand the hotel was very busy and the staff were as helpful as they could possibly be,0

 The first room we were giving was a basement room which was tiny and freezing as the window wasn t properly sealed which in December isn t great They did however move us to a slightly larger room which was nice and warm I thought overall it was very expensive for what it was ,0

 Hotel was excellent clean friendly helpful staff Had a wonderful nights sleep usually on a Saturday night in hotels you expect to be woken at least once by guest returning to their rooms this did not happen at all We were able to leave our luggage at reception and collect it when it was time for our train leaving us free to explore without worrying about caring our case withy us we even had a lovely young lady offer to carry our case out to the pavement for us which we declined but the gesture was lovely Loved the Apex rubber duck will be taking that on my travels and posting pictures to website ,1

the room next to us were quite loud at night time which proved it a bit difficult to sleep on times The bathroom was really damp due to the wet room and water went by the toilet so we had to wear shoes when using the bathroom after showering The staff member who checked us in charged us a 150 security fee and we were told that this would not be deducted from our bank only held but it was which resulted into the bank blocking my card due to an unauthorised foreign payment Check this when checking in and make sure the bank is aware,0

 I m not usually one to complain but the bathroom towel rail was permanently on and extremely hot The sink in the bathroom was very small Being on the first floor was extremely noisy in the morning and I was awakened early It was very hot in London this weekend and the air conditioning was broken making the room uncomfortable at times I was also unhappy that I d left some change out on the side in the bathroom and when I returned on Sunday evening that money had disappeared I know this is a small thing and it wasn t a great amount of money but it still should not have been taken Another gripe was that a wine glass from the night before was not taken away the next day either ,0

Stayed 4 days with my family for the London Marathon Not a good experience The hotel is always crowded and not relaxing Rooms as soon as you enter in a small dark and narrow room near the door you find the bed In the middle there s a small bathroom and kitchenette and near the window another small room with a sofa additional bed Satellite TV always bad signal so you find all the channels available but it is almost impossible to watch a programme without freezing and video problems interruptions The first sign that you see whan you arrive tells that guests have to expect long queues for breakfast and it is true Queues for everything breakfast in the weekends check in elevators The queue for breakfast was the worst one considering that I was with my parents who had to wait 15 mins standing before sitting Inaccurate room cleaning One day room was made at 16 00 the next day they didn t refurbish toilet paper and soap The next one they didn t remove used glasses and dishes The first day they started to knock at the door for service at 8 in the morning with people still in the room Breakfast room cold and inadeguate for the dimensions of this huge hotel Staff not very professional and trained with some exceptions Location near Waterloo station in front of the hotel there is a bus parking so when you are outside waiting for a taxi it is always complicate Beside road works in the street so noise and long alternative routes to cross the street To find some bars Overall this hotel was a terrible choice,0
I bought drinks at the bar not waiter service and they still tried to add the 8 service charge They were not happy when I queried it and asked for the money back Light lunch snacks were very average and overpriced,0
 Really modern room and bathroom had a choice of either bath or seperate shower,1

 We found the mattress a bit stiff have doubled the topper that helped Minor points Only one hook in bathroom we needed more Lights in cupboard fine but why no lights in tea coffee cupboard We could hardly see what we were doing with the hot water ,0
 This is a noisy overpriced hotel When I arrived they put me in a ground floor room next to the road really right next to it When I tried to go to sleep all I could hear were people outside and the television upstairs I requested a move and was given a new room Some where in the room was a boiler unit in the wall that would turn on every now and then and sound like a small jet engine In the morning I could here the person above me taking a shower and flushing the toilet ,0
Could have been more child friendly There were kids in the group that were 4 and six No facilities for children to play or be entertained,0
 The italian restaurant was a bit too low level with respect to the overall impression of the hotel inspite the Chianti was superb The Bar service was super lousy,0
 There was nothing to dislike ,0

 The Smart TV wasn t connected to the Internet So I couldn t connect my phone to tablet to it which kind of defeats the point of having a smart TV Also the view from the room was pretty much just the wall which ran alongside the building but on the ground floor you shouldn t really expect much else ,0

 I have booked a superior double room at Grand Royale What I have got was a two class single room in a bed and breakfast location called Shaftesbury Hyde Park International This is a bed breakfast location without any comfort the room was a single not a double room not very clean so small that I was unable to open my suitcase The heating system was off and the stuff needed two hours to put on the heating system So I have booked a superior double room at Grand Royale London Hyde Park a four stars hotel what I and another couple have got was a second standard bed breakfast two stars single room in a bed breakfast location in the same street this for a proice for a four stars hotel This is an illegal practice of the hotel which should have consequences ,0

Staff were excellent mentioned on booking that we were there to celebrate my mother s 60th birthday and the staff upgraded her room put a bottle of wine and a card and wrote a birthday message on the window My mother was delighted and this is the kind of thing that customer service is all about going the extra All of the staff we came across were helpful friendly and knowledgeable Special thanks to Elizabetta on Reception and Marta in the Bar they re the only names I remember and I hope I got them right Room was a very good size plenty of facilities provided including a microwave and crockery,1
Upgraded a standard room to a mini suite for just 20 00,1
 Unfort we had a dreadful experience in the Hotels Italian eatery after waiting an hour got food the staff came to explain they had lost the order could we start again we were famished to start with the complimentary breadsticks did not really lift our dissapointment,0
Mon Hotel is a charming boutique hotel located near Champs Elysees in a little street coming from l Avenue des Grand Armees near the Bus Direct stop airport shuttle The metro station Argentine line 1 is just 2 min away and it can lead you everywhere in town Very nice caf s and restaurants near by though not the most glamourous neighborhood you can find in Paris The mini market Le Marche d Etoile offers fresh fruits and all the basic things one might need The street is very quiet and the hotel is located in a very nice classical building The service at the reception is great loved it the staff is really helpful The room is so confy specially the bed Air conditioning works great as well as the wifi To end up the best features every room has a smartphone where you can navigate freely in and out of the hotel amazing right and before your stay the hotel sends you an email asking for your guest needs explaining how to get there nearby restaurants and attractions never experienced this kind of service before I was really WOWed Highly recommended,1
The d cor was good staff were friendly and the room was comfortable The stay consisted of myself and a friend just for one night We didn t have breakfast at the hotel so I wouldn t be able to comment on the food quality The hotel was perfectly located to get to Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park A short cab ride or 35 minute walk,1
 Beds are old and not comfortable at all Also the blankets need to be thicker or another blanket added especially during winter time ,0

 Long delay to get into room even though I arrived after check in time Room was dirty London eye view wasn t proper as blocked by other hotel shouldn t have to pay for the poor view,0
 Loved the breakfast the quiet yet convenient location and the fascinating history of the place which is said to have been refurbished by Edward VII as Prince of Wales for his actress mistress Lille Langtry The ornate public rooms are lovely as is the pocket sized theatre ,1
A little farther from Paddington Station than l expected 24hour room service would be nice,0

I was very dissapointed with this property our daughter booked and paid for this as a birthday present we had hassle checking in the receptionist wanted a copy of the card for security as this wasnt our card we didnt have it we offered our own card to use and they wanted to refund our daughters card which would take 10 days and take the money for the room from us there was no reason to do this and was a bad start to our trip Also the pictures are very misleading the rooms were tiny I wouldnt return here but would definitely return to the area,0

 This hotel was a great value near the tube station in Earl s Court It was one of the few places in London that offered three twin beds in one room which was perfect for us since we were traveling with our daughter It was very clean and charming with comfortable beds and in a lovely quiet neighborhood proximate to transportation to everything There was a nice little lounge bar in the lobby that we stopped into every night after our touring ,1
 We like to walk back from the theatre at night maybe for some people it would be few hundred meters past their comfort zone The room was very good and staff very helpful ,1
 Nothing it was great ,0
 Location was very good and a very nice hotel staff all politie and helpful definitely want to stay here again later on in the year ,1
 Quiet and beautifully furnished,1
 At first the room that was given to us was not the luxury double that was booked It was a very small room But the staff kindly moved us into a bigger room and apologised for the inconvenience ,0
 New hotel high standards great service,1

 Superb location and excellent room,1
 Very warm welcome from staff with an offer of an upgrade given Email received from manager the day after we checked out which was a lovely touch ,1
 Staff were very friendly and helpful Nice little bar area just off reception Bed very comfortable Price excellent for this part of London ,1
 Rooms just slightly claustrophobic no TV controller Just too dark ,0
 Bath too small ,0
Where should I start This hotel is rated a 4 star although it was a clean facility with good amenities the location was a nightmare for anyone especially families The metro station is nearby but you have to walk through a very very dirty and shady area It looks like a war zone The area was full of homeless refugees that are living under a bridge across the hotel It is not safe to walk from the metro to the hotel You have to take taxi to ensure your safety I do not recommend this hotel until this area is cleaned up and refugees are no longer misplaced I asked for a refund and management refused This hotel location put a damper our tourist experience in Paris,0
 Really made it special for my niece,1
 room too small,0
 Good but not value for money ,1
 Very clean room,1
 The mirror arrangements in the room were awkward to use for my wife The room One of the hidden wardrobes could have had shelves in it for extra storage The lack of double glazing meant we had to use the supplementary heater each evening Only one comfy chair made TV watching awkward and difficult We did not take breakfast as we considered the room rate should have been inclusive of b fast ,0

 Staff were terrible on check in We arrived late and last minute so booked on bookings com beforehand When we arrived they said their system hadn t updated and we were then treated like an inconvenience despite showing booking references and confirmations One receptionist even pulled faces and thought it was funny More training of late night reception staff Interestingly the trainee receptionist was actually the most personable of them all ,0
 Overall staff were excellent Quality of food was superior to most hotel restaurants with good price points Wraps etc freshly prepared so able to accommodate changes Room service curry very good Handy phone was an unexpected bonus as it included free calls to the USA allowing me to resolve issues with AT T not properly applying international adjustments Room had excellent soundproofing and air conditioning especially in this heat wave Bed very comfortable and bedding great Reception staff very helpful graciously coordinated an early check in Shower was awesome with superb water pressure and nice no water shortage compared to US so no need to recycle towels etc House keeping did a great job too The door staff could not do enough to assist guests very attentive and friendly ,1
 Not much choice of food on the room service menu Would have liked hot chocolate in addition to tea and coffee in room ,0

 Great location fabulous breakfast kid s meal in the bar great value for money Overall good value for money ,1
 Our rooms were in underground floor it s nothing specifically bad but was not mentioned during booking Unstable wi fi signal in the room but still working The worst part is tiny bathroom It combines toilet and shower on a very small patch and if you are not alone after one person takes a shower everything around like floor toilet is absolutely wet ,0
Excellent location 2 minutes to Earl s Court underground clean room and new facilities friendly staff a good variety of breakfast to choose from,1
 Nothing Not a good hotel The one next to it looked better and well maintained ,1
 Everything could not fault it,1
 The hotel suited our needs and met with our expectations The staff were very welcoming efficient and of a pleasant demeanour The hotel was clean and tidy and facilities in the room all worked,1

 I love everything about this hotel it s in a perfect location round the corner from the tube but in a quiet street The breakfast caters for all tastes and is plentiful and delicious The rooms and beds are comfortable and very clean the staff can t do enough for you The whole feel of the hotel is up to and excelling in some cases the standard of an expensive West End hotel but with a cosy feel to it It s my favourite hotel in London and I ve stayed in quite a few ,1

Staff were very helpful and friendly Close to 2 underground stations Very quiet in hotel room we stayed in a room over the courtyard,1
I ll start off with the location was good for what we needed But It was freezing cold in the room all night I had to call to ask for extra blankets at 4am felt like I was camping outside Had to call twice and wait 25minutes to get an extra blanket The room was an ok size but didn t expect our seperate beds to be together There was one plug outlet for the room as well which was frustrating The throw blanket on the bed was torn and stained as well so that wasn t very nice Noise coming from upstairs and next door We only needed it for the night so I guess it did what I needed to do but I probably wouldn t stay there again,0
 Soundproofing was poor could hear everything from outside our room and woke one morning thinking someone had come into our room as sound was so clear Service and food in the restaurant was awful at dinner so we didn t eat there again ,0
 Great room spotlessly clean brilliant location very pleasant and helpful staff ,1
 Breakfast a bit expensive,0
 The area is dodgy and not safe,0
The rooms are very very small we only had 2 small suitcases and there was no room for them The breakfast isn t great we were given it complementary but would have been very disappointed if I d paid for it,0
I booked a night with the wrong date canceled and rebooked for the next night The booking was made within 24 hours of the stay and the cancellation was not processed When I arrived they insisted I pay for the canceled booking I should have just walked away but thought I could resolve it They were rude and steadfast in insisting I pay for the canceled night I contacted Booking com to help resolve the situation Booking com were very helpful recognized I had made a mistake booking the wrong night and contacted the hotel to resolve the issue The hotel blankly refused Not very nice people at all I would never stay again,0

The staff were very polite and courteous and made us feel very welcome They wrote a happy birthday message on the window of our suite as it was my wife s 50th Birthday she was very touched by this,1
 Wonderful hotel in an excellent location Rooms are well furnished and comfortable with tea coffee facilities iron etc supplied on request The hotel also has a great gym and pool area The staff are without doubt some of the best we ve encountered in the hotels we ve stayed at very professional helpful and friendly Cocktails in the lobby bar are fantastic if a little pricy We dined one evening at the Eneko restaurant in the hotel basement which is very highly recommended fab food ambience ,1

 Great breakfast,1
I have used this hotel a few times before and never been disappointed however our room this time 118 was quite shabby inside compared to previous visits There wasn t even any bottled water Also on trying to find the room at 11 30pm after a long day the signage was very misleading and led us to a door which was closed off and unavailable due to construction We then had to get a member of staff to show us the alternative route which we would never have found had we followed the brass signage,0
 Everything I needed ,1
 the little extras in the room such as complimentary snacks water etc slippers and quality toiletries,1
 All in all a great hotel ,0
 Excellent location near Kensington Gardens for a lovely walk and interesting places to visit bus and tube very close to explore the city restaurants pubs shops nearby The hotel is a lovely building full of fascinating history and ornate decoration Good facilities and all the staff very helpful Wide choice to suit everyone for breakfast and a lovely Afternoon Tea in the beautiful dining room ,1

Uuufhh Where do I even start The rooms have no space you feel confined in them You can hear the person next door through the walls The hotel is a long walk from the nearest station The housekeeping lady kept coming into my room without knocking on my door she came 4 times between 11 and 12 noon her excuse she wanted to clean the room even though I told her not come in again The hotel should be 2 star and I don t know how they were rated 4 star Perhaps it is self acclaimed I wouldn t advise anyone to go there you ll regret it and wish you hadn t A word they say is enough for the wise but these are alot of words,0
 Hotel was really nice staff were very friendly and helpful I requested a split level room which they gave me when I arrived The room it self was extremely nice and clean and the bed was very comfy The hotel is not in the centre however is a walkable distance or easily got to by the Metro Would definitely recommend this hotel and will be returning ,1

 The location is excellent it s a very comfortable and beautiful hotel with affordable price Near you can find Russel Square station from where you can go anywhere and it s just a short walk from stores and restaurants And the food there is excellent ,1

 The elevator is too small for the hotel s size On the other hand at least they have one ,0
 The room we had was perfect for the three days we spent there and the bathroom was top class ,1
 Excellent location Nice and quiet with easy access to the Earl s Court Tube station ,1
We went for my husband s 40th birthday The manager kindly arranged for a complimentary birthday card and beautifully wrapped box of chocolates to be left in the room For a fee they sprinkled rose petals from the door to the bed where they put the petals in the shape of a heart There were more around the bath too A lovely extra touch We were given a free upgrade too without even asking The staff couldn t do enough to help They even gave us a second free duck as we said we had two children The room was really clean and modern bed extra comfy shower fantastic The details of Elemis toiletries and free jelly beans and Pringles were an excellent bonus I cannot fault it and would definitely stay again Location is excellent Close to Blackfriars tube station Excellent excellent excellent,1
Just walking in the reception could be made a bit more comfortable perhaps seating for more than 1 person a table for brochures Also we found that the area had many good local restaurants which could be printed on a simple map as well as grocery stores hairdresser etc These were in walking distance to the hotel and would be a great help for first time visitors,0
 Although we had an upgrade the bed was situated by the entry door and the view over looked Waterloo station with the Shard way in the distance Having stayed at Park Plaza before the scenic view wasn t as good as what we ve experienced in the past i e the London Eye Despite this we still had a pleasant stay and I would recommend the Park Plaza County Hall ,0
 Staff location and cleanliness,1
 The bed was uncomfortable the bath was not able to be emptied due to a faulty waste system and perhaps most disappointing was the club lounge which only served drinks with no snacks One of the fridges was broken and the coffee machine was temperamental A poor experience compared to the Hilton or other equivalent lounges I wouldn t have minded that much but I purposely opted for the more expensive room with lounge access ,0

 Booking in could not get name wrong did not set up charging facilities and dire bedroom Eveywherr was poorly lit Very slow dinner service,0
 Great staff and good location nice and clean,1
 I wish the staff could speak better English I found it very difficult at times to be understood and for them to understand me and the food and everything was nice but the service could have been faster I m not sure why waiting staff didn t think to come back after they ve dropped your meal to see if you would like something else or tea coffee dessert etc A small thing but annoying ,0
No hot water on 2 of the mornings,0
 The friendliness and courtesy of all the staff from the check in desk to the dining room staff I loved the comfortable bed the view over Russell Square gardens the high ceilings and ornate deco and the buffet breakfasts with everything anybody could possibly ask for even me as a vegetarian ,1

Booking through booking com did not give a breakfast option at 15 pounds per person times three people times three days this was quite significant booking directley through the hotel would have had breakfast included at the same rate,0
 I didn t want maid service but the maid put a bag of fresh towels on the door regardless which was nice ,1

 The room was not what I expected from the booking and a hotel of this nature the manager has been directly reviewing the concerns and contacted me directly ,0
To all weary travellers I booked a four night stay at The Park Grand hotel in London Paddington Having just arrived from a long journey and I checked into my room and went straight to bed Not long after drifting off to the land of nod I awoke to a burning sensation severe itchiness to my upper torso neck hands and arms Upon further inspection I soon discovered the bed was riddled with bedbugs and these free loaders I counted in the double digits After contacting reception I was greeted by the hotel manager and an assistant to assess the extent of the infestation By this time my bites had swollen to a collection of bright red bump The manager and equally his assistant were shocked at the state of the bed and they moved me to the room down the hallway The following morning I spoke to another manager to request a full refund for the previous night as well as requested relocation to a lower floor just in case my new friends decided to pay me another visit The manager advised me that a full refund was not practical and that the best they could do for me at the time was to give a 20 discount on the room which I did not accept for the previous evening and wash my clothes to prevent any stowaways At one point throughout the discussion the manager even intimated that I may be responsible for the infestation and that he would investigate the situation adding insult to injury This certainly did put me at ease and I did not feel like a valued customer Instead of giving the hotel the benefit of the doubt and continuing my stay I requested that my room be cancelled and to refund the remaining nights As anticipated I was told that I should give 24 hours notice in order to cancel so I had to stay one more night before leaving to a neighbouring hotel I short the attitude of the hotel was woeful and the manner in which they dealt with their customers albeit the general staff was pleasant and helpful,0
 toilet is very small,0
the bathroom was a mess 4 star hotel with no shower cabine just a shower head and curtain that if you were not carefull flooded the whole room also our room was in the basement,0
 Let me think about it Nothing really ,0
